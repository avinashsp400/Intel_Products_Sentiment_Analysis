Best CPU for Budget Ballers.",Reviewed in India on 15 June 2024,"This processor is great mid to high range budget builds, if your looking for a cpu for around 10K INR, this is the perfect choice, it has 6 Cores and 12 Threads which is quite powerful. For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60° while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.Overall 9.5/10 product.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Great process but pathetic Stock cooler",Reviewed in India on 3 April 2022,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",4.0 out of 5 stars

In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),5.0 out of 5 stars

Il se distingue par sa gravure en 10 nm, son support du PCIe 5.0 et du Thunderbolt 4, ainsi que sa compatibilité avec la mémoire DDR4 ou DDR5. Il s'agit d'un processeur sans circuit graphique intégré, ce qui implique l'utilisation d'une carte graphique dédiée.Le Core i5-12400F dispose de 6 cœurs hautes performances (P-Core) et de 12 threads, grâce à la technologie Hyperthreading. Il affiche une fréquence de base de 2,5 GHz et peut atteindre jusqu'à 4,4 GHz en mode Turbo. Il dispose également d'un cache L3 de 18 Mo et d'un cache L2 de 7,5 Mo.Le Core i5-12400F offre des performances remarquables dans les applications et les jeux. Il se montre capable de rivaliser avec des processeurs plus haut de gamme, comme le Ryzen 5 5600X d'AMD ou le Core i7-11700K d'Intel. Il est particulièrement performant dans les tâches qui exploitent le multithreading, comme l'encodage vidéo, la compression ou le rendu. Il assure également une fluidité optimale dans les jeux les plus récents, même en haute résolution.Le Core i5-12400F se distingue également par son efficacité énergétique. Il affiche une consommation électrique de base de 65 watts et une consommation maximale de 117 watts[^1^][1]. Il est donc facile à refroidir et ne nécessite pas un système de refroidissement trop coûteux ou bruyant. Il permet également de réduire la facture d'électricité et l'impact environnemental.Le Core i5-12400F est donc un excellent choix pour ceux qui cherchent un processeur puissant, polyvalent et économe en énergie. Il offre un rapport qualité-prix imbattable pour profiter pleinement des avantages de la 12e génération d'Intel. Il nécessite toutefois une carte mère compatible avec le socket LGA1700 et une carte graphique dédiée.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6, Cpu with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket, Micro Atx",No review title,Reviewed in Italy on 6 March 2023,"INTROCome è giusto che sia, anziché comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessità di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perché trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualità. Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque è identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino più alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie più costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo più 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni più complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni più ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, è eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttività utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie può sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarà usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perché non mi è arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece è decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che è accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale è abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perché per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente è necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilità della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che è una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perché ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? Perché con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lì a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che può sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che può sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata è la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 è la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissà cosa. La potenza di questa è simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giù di lì, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due è la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore è scarso ma per una CPU come questa è sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore è il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perché.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco più alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente più potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze più alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di più o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata è di poco più potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100€ in più. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perché mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anziché il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece è su un altro campo da gioco, ed è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze più alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150€ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget più alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU più potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 è una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. È eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Si evince solo dal modello che finisce con “f” ma non essendo tutti quelli che acquistano tecnici si possono trovare nell’acquistare una cpu che necessita di altri soldi per funzionare. Si vede solo in maniera davvero minima dal cartone scritto in inglese e in piccolo. Quindi ottimo ma attenzione che questo modello necessità di scheda video pci-express",5.0 out of 5 stars

I do not regret this at all. The performance is amazing and can run CPU-intensive games well along with my 3060ti. The stock cooler provided is also amazing and simple to install, but would have preferred if it came with metal mounting screws instead of cheap-feeling plastic push pins.The price is well below other retail shops in Singapore including Sim Lim square. Although it is shipped from overseas, it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged. The shipping time also took less than a week.The only problem was that motherboards with LGA 1700 sockets (that supports 12gen Intel processors) are currently much more expensive than LGA 1200 or AMD counterparts, so I had to settle with a non ideal mATX motherboard to stay within my budget.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It feels incredibly snappy now.  With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%.  (@2560x1080)  Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating.  It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.As of this posting, it's hard to beat the value of this CPU (12400F/12400) for gaming.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For the price it's dang near perfect.  It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs.  It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7,2.0 out of 5 stars

If you want to save a lot, you could go with a 12100f, but I think you get a lot of value with this cpu. You get the faster pcie lanes and more of them compared to the 10th and 11th gen cpus. And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests.

Very good gaming performance. Will not bottleneck your GPU. Even if you have a 3080\3070 Ti, or a 6800\ 6800XT this CPU will deliver great performance. I have bought 2 so far and I even paired them with a budget ASRock B660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with  135W PL2. This CPU will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great IPC performance and is compatible with DDR5 RAM. All this for approx $180-220 is a bargain. If you don't need to overclock or don't want to spend a great deal of money this is the CPU for you.

Déjà parce qu'il était destiné à être placé dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliqué, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/énergie.Je pense que c'est mission accomplie. En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI)  ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour résumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destiné à un usage polyvalent et économique.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Se ovviamente si cerca un prodotto entrylevel. Dalle recensioni ha prestazioni da fascia superiore di qualche anno fa, la CPU ha 4 core con HT quindi gestisce 8Th.L'ho acquistata per un secondo PC in un case micro-ATX con una sola 92mm posteriore in estrazione. Come prestazioni e reattività la CPU è veramente niente male navigazione, riproduzione. Ho fatto qualche bench tipo CPUZ e va un pò di più del mio R5 1600 in multi (6c/12t) e molto di più in ST.In buona sostanza se cercate una CPU per uso navigazione, riproduzione, produttività leggera, gaming (magari retrogaming su giochi DX11) è il prodotto giusto. Se fate gaming su giochi moderni (DX12) e con obiettivo di refresh sostenuti (anche minimi) allora meglio un 12400 o superiore (parlando di Intel).Ho fatto dei test con Intelburntest e la CPU resta a 4,089GHz su tutti i core con T di 75° in inverno e 82° a Luglio. Premetto che uso il dissi stock ho solo cambiato la pasta termica (arctic MX4).  La ventola tende a girare un po' veloce per tenere la T sotto controllo, comunque non è rumorosissima anzi.

Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process.

I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Install was easy & doesn't have the annoying fragile socket pins older CPUs used to have. You just place it on the socket close the bracket install your cooler & it should be good to go. I seem to have very good frame rate stability & seems to be able to handle most games even without a GPU. If a game used to be on console it'll likely work with this CPU & perform better than gaming console CPUs. I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price. Was going to go with an i7 13700K this ended up costing half the price of the i7 & an i7 may be a bit overkill for most of the games I plan on playing on my PC anyway.

I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).",5.0 out of 5 stars

The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt.

It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

"Intel Core i7-13700K Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) 30M Cache, up to 5.4 GHz Socket LGA 1700",No review title,Reviewed in Japan on 23 November 2022,最上位モデルのCore i9-13900kと悩みましたが、コア数同スペックでピーク性能とワットパフォーマンスが向上しているこちらのCore i7-13700kを選びました。Z690マザーボードで運用していますがBIOSが対応していれば特に問題なし。最近のマザーボードは電源だけあればBIOS更新可能なので非対応BIOSでも問題ないことが多いです。デバイスドライバ類は事前に最新に更新（又は新規インストールの場合はダウンロード）しておくことをお勧めします。CinebenchR23のスコアはマルチ30552、シングル2082。Core i9-12900Kから約1割程度スコアが伸びていて、フルロード時の消費電力は約30Wほど低くなっているのでいい感じです。10nmと他社の現行製品と比べると２～３世代落ちなプロセスルールで健闘しているとは思いますが、360mm簡易水冷クーラー必須な点はAlder Lakeから変わらず評価が分かれるかと思います。フルロード時のワットパフォーマンスは正直微妙です。今回取り付けたのはゲーミングPC用なので動画のエンコードなどはさせないため個人的には大満足です。エンコード処理メインなら大型空冷クーラーで問題なく動作する旧型ですが扱いやすく、価格も安くなっているRyzen 9 5950Xをおすすめします。ゲームメインならシングルスレッド性能の高いCore i7-13700kはワットパフォーマンスもコストパフォーマンスも高いのでおすすめです！,5.0 out of 5 stars

And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use.

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c.

Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2°-3° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k.

In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is.

Plenty of sites for that kind of measurement. I'm going to tell you, being a 20 year IT professional, this is a solid processor. I replaced a Xeon E3-1225 with this processor. Even coming from a Xeon for productivity and virtualization, this is a solid upgrade. My system is stable, performs faster, programs execute faster, and my VMs within my labs operate far more efficiently and provide the fast operation requires for a IT professional. If you are considering the 10600, then this is worth the consideration if you're in the productivity space. If you're in the overclock gaming space, then, no, this processor isn't the best option out there. However, it is reasonably priced, has some good mainboard support options, and I even ported over my RAM from my 4+ year old Xeon system without any problems.So, this is not the MOST economic processor. However, its relatively economic, stable, has good hardware support options, and provides a solid improvement over prior generation Intel products. Point is, if you're looking to buy a solid CPU, this is a good bet.If you're looking to overclock the thing into a lava pit in your tower, just go elsewhere and don't give negative reviews when YOU are the one out of spec.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I paired his with a GTX 1660 super and it performs pretty well, not as good as a 12400 or Ryzen 5 3600 or 5600x, but very close. Only downside going with a 10th gen instead of 11 or newer is the lack of PCIe and m.2 gen 4 support, although neither PC needs those features as neither will saturate the bandwidth of gen 3 fully. The integrated graphics will run some light games (among us, CSGO, etc. ) At lowered settings. The included cooler is as bad as it's always been, it works, loud and temps aren't great, but it works. I would Suggest finding a better solution (I went vetroo V5). Buy this CPU if it's on sale for $140 or less, otherwise go 11th gen or Ryzen.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Intel® Core i5-10400 Processor (12M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 7 June 2020,"This CPU is definitely an upgrade from the quad core i7-4770 (non-K) that I previously had! Glad to see the i5 now has hyperthreading, thanks to AMD. But, I may have gotten the worst performing 10400, as my Cinebench R20 and R15 scores are noticeably lower than the benchmarks you'd see online (both single core and multi core and I've got all my drivers/bios installed and up to date). Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase as this CPU is no slouch. Currently have it paired with an Asus Prime B460-Plus and a Zotac GTX 1070. Be aware that there's two versions of the i5-10400. One has G1 stepping (pure 6 core chip and no STIM) and the other has Q0 stepping (10 core chip with 4 cores disabled, uses the newer thermal interface and shares the similar heat spreader from the higher-end unlocked SKUs). Though, the two should perform very similarly.Update 9/9/20: Went to the previous generation platform and currently using an i9-9900K. 10th generation ain't too bad, but it's best to wait on 11th generation Rocket Lake. It's rumored to use a 14nm backport of WIllow Cove... or just wait on Zen 3. For now, I'm waiting to upgrade my 1070 to the new RTX 3080 when it becomes available at my local Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Intel® Core i5-10400 Processor (12M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 20 December 2020,"Choosing a processor is all about economics. With so many processor choices on the market, the trick is finding a balance between price and power. For me, the 10400 was the perfect balance. A lot of reviews are recommending the AMD Ryzen processors, but it seems most of these reviews are geared to gamers. Unfortunately, the latest Ryzen processors do not include graphics processing on board, and the reviews ignore this point because gamers always include a graphics card in their builds. Well I am not a gamer, and don't need to waste money on a graphics board. So the fact that the 10400 comes with onboard graphics was a selling point for me. I play WoW, and have no problems playing with the integrated UHD chipset. With 6 cores and hyperthreading, this processor is like buying a previous-generation i7. I can run multiple virtual machines on my desktop with no slowdown whatsoever. Nor do I want to overclock, since reliability is more important to me than squeezing a few more clock cycles. I think this hits the perfect balance between power and affordability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Please note that 9-th generation motherboard is NOT compatible with  the 10-th generation processor as the socket has changed.  My desktop computer only has a 200W power supply so a 65W process is perfect for this purpose.  With the 65W consideration, the mid level i5 10400 is around ~180 compared to the entry i3 10100 of ~120, high end i7 10700 ~300+ and i9 10900 ~400+.  The speed improvement certainly worth the extra ~60 dollars without breaking your wallet for the i7 and i9.  The i7 and i9 are certainly great but it may not worth the price given what they are worth.  It may be wiser to spend the extra to invest more into the graphics card instead.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The later, more sought after Q0 versions would be labeled SRH78. While the physical appearance on the bottom of the chips would easily reveal the distinctions, that isn't visible through the standard boxing window. And, to make matters more confusing, while the OEM parts have different numbers for the different S-Specs, the retail part numbers appear to be the same for either version.There are fairly significant internal and external differences as to how Intel went about producing the two versions, but the actual performance of the two methods looks to be basically identical. It's primarily the heat dispersion capacity that will be most obviously different.While the vendor can't actually be faulted for an incorrect listing as long as only the part number is quoted and no mention is made of the S-Spec designation, I feel this info should be part of the description,",4.0 out of 5 stars

The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing.

Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming.

There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit.

The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k.

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hier sind meine Eindrücke nach intensiver Nutzung:Leistung:Mit seinen 24 Kernen und einer beeindruckenden Taktrate liefert der i9-14900KF eine unglaubliche Leistung. Egal ob beim Gaming, bei der Videobearbeitung oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor meistert alles mühelos. In Spielen wie Cyberpunk 2077 und Red Dead Redemption 2 laufen die Grafiken butterweich, selbst bei höchsten Einstellungen. Die Ladezeiten sind minimal und das Gameplay ist absolut flüssig.Multitasking:Ich arbeite oft mit mehreren anspruchsvollen Anwendungen gleichzeitig – von Adobe Premiere Pro über Photoshop bis hin zu Blender. Der i9-14900KF bewältigt diese Aufgaben ohne ins Schwitzen zu geraten. Selbst wenn ich ein Video rendere und gleichzeitig in einem anderen Fenster an einem großen Bildbearbeitungsprojekt arbeite, bleibt das System reaktionsschnell und stabil.Kühlung:Apropos Kühlung – der i9-14900KF kann unter Last ziemlich warm werden. Ich habe mich für eine hochwertige Wasserkühlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten kühl und leise.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis:Der Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn für gerechtfertigt. Für Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance benötigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.Fazit:Der Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die Möglichkeit zur Übertaktung bietet zusätzlichen Spielraum für Performance-Enthusiasten. Auch wenn er etwas teurer ist und eine gute Kühlung erfordert, bin ich rundum zufrieden mit meiner Wahl und kann den i9-14900KF jedem empfehlen, der das Beste aus seinem System herausholen möchte.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable.

The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",5.0 out of 5 stars

If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to goThis thing is a monster .,1.0 out of 5 stars

It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2024,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 7 December 2023,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)",5.0 out of 5 stars

If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",4.0 out of 5 stars

In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),5.0 out of 5 stars

"Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6, Cpu with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket, Micro Atx",No review title,Reviewed in Italy on 6 March 2023,"INTROCome è giusto che sia, anziché comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessità di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perché trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualità. Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque è identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino più alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie più costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo più 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni più complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni più ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, è eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttività utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie può sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarà usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perché non mi è arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece è decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che è accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale è abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perché per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente è necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilità della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che è una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perché ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? Perché con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lì a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che può sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che può sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata è la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 è la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissà cosa. La potenza di questa è simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giù di lì, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due è la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore è scarso ma per una CPU come questa è sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore è il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perché.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco più alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente più potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze più alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di più o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata è di poco più potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100€ in più. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perché mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anziché il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece è su un altro campo da gioco, ed è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze più alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150€ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget più alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU più potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 è una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. È eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sono soddisfatto anche delle sue prestazioni in gaming dove mi permette di giocare in QHD, ovviamente con scheda video dedicata, a giochi AAA come Cyberpunk 2077.Il processore è veloce ed affidabile, non ho riscontrato nessun problema a distanza di quasi un anno ne di prestazioni ne, dopo aver montato un buon dissipatore after market, di temperature.A proposito di temperature, unica pecca, montando il dissipatore in stock le temperature, anche con scarso carico, si attestavano sui 70 gradi.

"Intel Core i5-12400 Desktop Processor 18M Cache, up to 4.40 GHz LGA 1700 Socket",No review title,Reviewed in Singapore on 28 April 2022,"I was initially only bought this due to it being the most affordable mid range CPU at 290 SGD for my new build, and was also considering similarly priced AMD Ryzen 5600X, but settled on this ultimately. I do not regret this at all. The performance is amazing and can run CPU-intensive games well along with my 3060ti. The stock cooler provided is also amazing and simple to install, but would have preferred if it came with metal mounting screws instead of cheap-feeling plastic push pins.The price is well below other retail shops in Singapore including Sim Lim square. Although it is shipped from overseas, it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged. The shipping time also took less than a week.The only problem was that motherboards with LGA 1700 sockets (that supports 12gen Intel processors) are currently much more expensive than LGA 1200 or AMD counterparts, so I had to settle with a non ideal mATX motherboard to stay within my budget.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It feels incredibly snappy now.  With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%.  (@2560x1080)  Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating.  It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.  Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.As of this posting, it's hard to beat the value of this CPU (12400F/12400) for gaming.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Déjà parce qu'il était destiné à être placé dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliqué, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/énergie.Je pense que c'est mission accomplie. En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI)  ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour résumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destiné à un usage polyvalent et économique.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Se ovviamente si cerca un prodotto entrylevel. Dalle recensioni ha prestazioni da fascia superiore di qualche anno fa, la CPU ha 4 core con HT quindi gestisce 8Th.L'ho acquistata per un secondo PC in un case micro-ATX con una sola 92mm posteriore in estrazione. Come prestazioni e reattività la CPU è veramente niente male navigazione, riproduzione. Ho fatto qualche bench tipo CPUZ e va un pò di più del mio R5 1600 in multi (6c/12t) e molto di più in ST.In buona sostanza se cercate una CPU per uso navigazione, riproduzione, produttività leggera, gaming (magari retrogaming su giochi DX11) è il prodotto giusto. Se fate gaming su giochi moderni (DX12) e con obiettivo di refresh sostenuti (anche minimi) allora meglio un 12400 o superiore (parlando di Intel).Ho fatto dei test con Intelburntest e la CPU resta a 4,089GHz su tutti i core con T di 75° in inverno e 82° a Luglio. Premetto che uso il dissi stock ho solo cambiato la pasta termica (arctic MX4).  La ventola tende a girare un po' veloce per tenere la T sotto controllo, comunque non è rumorosissima anzi.

Monte à plus 3000 rpm à pleine charge ce qui occasionne pas mal de bruit.Le processeur atteint les 80 degrés en phase de stress test, ce qui est correct, mais pas optimum ( il y a 20 degrés de marge avant l arret de sécurité, toutefois même en jeu le processeur atteint rarement les 60%).Investir dans un venti-rad ne sera pas un luxe.Dans le cas où vous utiliseriez quand même de le venti-rad de série, pensez à prendre de la pâte thermique.

Was a software issue, not a hardware issue.NEW REVIEW (5 Stars):I'm a video editor, and I usually only upgrade once every 5-7 years, and this thing more than DOUBLES the performance of my old i5 7600K 4C/4T CPU from 2017.  6P/4E cores for under $200. Wow. I was able to pick this thing up for $150 on Black Friday in 2023 and it's worth every penny.Paired it with a Deepcool AK400 cooler which I picked up for around $30 and it keeps temps around 70-75 while running Cinebench and other similar benchmarks (it's worth noting, however, that I haven't overclocked it).This with a $300 RTX 3060 from MSI with 12GB of VRAM and I have a beast of a 4K Premiere Pro workhorse that should keep me happy for another 5-7 years.A quick note if you use Premiere Pro and aren't aware:If you use Premiere Pro, you absolutely NEED the K series of intel chips. Do NOT cheap out and get an intel chip without an iGPU! The integrated graphics chips in the K series have decoders specifically designed for h264 footage to decode that footage in Premiere Pro, allowing for buttery-smooth playback on your timeline with little to no dropped frames.According to benchmarks, without the iGPU, you can see as much as a 20-30% drop in such tasks! Do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20-$30 to get that iGPU for decoding! (You'll still need a good dedicated GPU to handle GPU-intensive effects.Hope this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Mixed with a DeepCool AK620 and non overclocked I finally figure out the formula too achieve 4K ultra Gaming on most games that I play on a regular basis. I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process. I can go through a hundred tabs an hour and not have to worry about internal latency. It's good",5.0 out of 5 stars

I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

Factor this into your overall build cost.Final Verdict:The Intel Core i7-13700K is a top-tier processor for serious gamers, demanding content creators, and overclocking enthusiasts. Its blistering performance, PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, and overclocking headroom make it a future-proof powerhouse. However, the high price, heat generation, and DDR5 compatibility requirements might be dealbreakers for some. If you're looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi-core performance and have the budget for a premium build, the i7-13700K is a worthy investment. Just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool.Note:This review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks. Your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration",1.0 out of 5 stars

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).",5.0 out of 5 stars

The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt.

It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to.

I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c.

Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen.

Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.That being said, this processor is a monster. It’s a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up. Most stable and speedy system I’ve ever owned. 13th gen might have come out before Ryzen 7000 series, but I still think it’s the winner.EK’s Nucleus 360mm AIO did a great job at keeping this CPU under control.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2°-3° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k. The gains would probably not be really experienced.",4.0 out of 5 stars

In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Plenty of sites for that kind of measurement. I'm going to tell you, being a 20 year IT professional, this is a solid processor. I replaced a Xeon E3-1225 with this processor. Even coming from a Xeon for productivity and virtualization, this is a solid upgrade. My system is stable, performs faster, programs execute faster, and my VMs within my labs operate far more efficiently and provide the fast operation requires for a IT professional. If you are considering the 10600, then this is worth the consideration if you're in the productivity space. If you're in the overclock gaming space, then, no, this processor isn't the best option out there. However, it is reasonably priced, has some good mainboard support options, and I even ported over my RAM from my 4+ year old Xeon system without any problems.So, this is not the MOST economic processor. However, its relatively economic, stable, has good hardware support options, and provides a solid improvement over prior generation Intel products.

I paired his with a GTX 1660 super and it performs pretty well, not as good as a 12400 or Ryzen 5 3600 or 5600x, but very close. Only downside going with a 10th gen instead of 11 or newer is the lack of PCIe and m.2 gen 4 support, although neither PC needs those features as neither will saturate the bandwidth of gen 3 fully. The integrated graphics will run some light games (among us, CSGO, etc. ) At lowered settings. The included cooler is as bad as it's always been, it works, loud and temps aren't great, but it works.

"Intel® Core i5-10400 Processor (12M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 7 June 2020,"This CPU is definitely an upgrade from the quad core i7-4770 (non-K) that I previously had! Glad to see the i5 now has hyperthreading, thanks to AMD. But, I may have gotten the worst performing 10400, as my Cinebench R20 and R15 scores are noticeably lower than the benchmarks you'd see online (both single core and multi core and I've got all my drivers/bios installed and up to date). Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase as this CPU is no slouch. Currently have it paired with an Asus Prime B460-Plus and a Zotac GTX 1070. Be aware that there's two versions of the i5-10400. One has G1 stepping (pure 6 core chip and no STIM) and the other has Q0 stepping (10 core chip with 4 cores disabled, uses the newer thermal interface and shares the similar heat spreader from the higher-end unlocked SKUs). Though, the two should perform very similarly.Update 9/9/20: Went to the previous generation platform and currently using an i9-9900K. 10th generation ain't too bad, but it's best to wait on 11th generation Rocket Lake. It's rumored to use a 14nm backport of WIllow Cove... or just wait on Zen 3.

With so many processor choices on the market, the trick is finding a balance between price and power. For me, the 10400 was the perfect balance. A lot of reviews are recommending the AMD Ryzen processors, but it seems most of these reviews are geared to gamers. Unfortunately, the latest Ryzen processors do not include graphics processing on board, and the reviews ignore this point because gamers always include a graphics card in their builds. Well I am not a gamer, and don't need to waste money on a graphics board. So the fact that the 10400 comes with onboard graphics was a selling point for me. I play WoW, and have no problems playing with the integrated UHD chipset. With 6 cores and hyperthreading, this processor is like buying a previous-generation i7. I can run multiple virtual machines on my desktop with no slowdown whatsoever. Nor do I want to overclock, since reliability is more important to me than squeezing a few more clock cycles. I think this hits the perfect balance between power and affordability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The speed improvement certainly worth the extra ~60 dollars without breaking your wallet for the i7 and i9.

The later, more sought after Q0 versions would be labeled SRH78. While the physical appearance on the bottom of the chips would easily reveal the distinctions, that isn't visible through the standard boxing window. And, to make matters more confusing, while the OEM parts have different numbers for the different S-Specs, the retail part numbers appear to be the same for either version.There are fairly significant internal and external differences as to how Intel went about producing the two versions, but the actual performance of the two methods looks to be basically identical. It's primarily the heat dispersion capacity that will be most obviously different.While the vendor can't actually be faulted for an incorrect listing as long as only the part number is quoted and no mention is made of the S-Spec designation, I feel this info should be part of the description,",5.0 out of 5 stars

The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get.

Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k.

I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Wobei diese Kombination für einen Business- und Home-Office-PC auch heute noch unter Windows 10 leistungsmäßig völlig okay gewesen ist. Nur der Wechsel auf Windows 11 hätte früher oder später ohnehin ein Hardware-Update nötig gemacht … was durch den Defekt jetzt beschleunigt wurde.Das soll sozusagen mein Anforderungsprofil beschreiben. Und das erfüllt der 13100F. Onboard-Grafik brauche ich nicht, bei 3 Monitoren komme ich an einer Grafikkarte sowieso nicht vorbei. Die CPU ist vergleichsweise günstig, und sie ist für meine Zwecke mehr als schnell genug. Der geringe Stromhunger lässt den PC nahezu lautlos laufen und verspricht eine lange Lebensdauer.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in Germany on 11 June 2024,"Nachdem ich meinen PC mit dem Intel Core i9-14900KF aufgerüstet habe, kann ich sagen, dass dieser Prozessor ein echtes Kraftpaket ist. Hier sind meine Eindrücke nach intensiver Nutzung:Leistung:Mit seinen 24 Kernen und einer beeindruckenden Taktrate liefert der i9-14900KF eine unglaubliche Leistung. Egal ob beim Gaming, bei der Videobearbeitung oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor meistert alles mühelos. In Spielen wie Cyberpunk 2077 und Red Dead Redemption 2 laufen die Grafiken butterweich, selbst bei höchsten Einstellungen. Die Ladezeiten sind minimal und das Gameplay ist absolut flüssig.Multitasking:Ich arbeite oft mit mehreren anspruchsvollen Anwendungen gleichzeitig – von Adobe Premiere Pro über Photoshop bis hin zu Blender. Der i9-14900KF bewältigt diese Aufgaben ohne ins Schwitzen zu geraten. Selbst wenn ich ein Video rendere und gleichzeitig in einem anderen Fenster an einem großen Bildbearbeitungsprojekt arbeite, bleibt das System reaktionsschnell und stabil.Kühlung:Apropos Kühlung – der i9-14900KF kann unter Last ziemlich warm werden. Ich habe mich für eine hochwertige Wasserkühlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten kühl und leise.Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis:Der Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn für gerechtfertigt. Für Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance benötigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.Fazit:Der Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die Möglichkeit zur Übertaktung bietet zusätzlichen Spielraum für Performance-Enthusiasten. Auch wenn er etwas teurer ist und eine gute Kühlung erfordert, bin ich rundum zufrieden mit meiner Wahl und kann den i9-14900KF jedem empfehlen, der das Beste aus seinem System herausholen möchte.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.

Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 2 June 2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast.

The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",3.0 out of 5 stars

If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to goThis thing is a monster .,5.0 out of 5 stars

It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs.

User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use.

I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80.

It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

I used to use Asus all my life (beginning from core 2 duo processors or even Pentium 4).So, the system was ready to go and it was fast, quiet desktop with Fractal Design R4 case and Noctua D15 cooler( with two fans).No more fans than stock ones in my FD case (one for intake and other for outtake at the back).I OCed the system to 48Ghz at 1.26 Adaptive voltage or so (I don't remember exact number of voltage but 100% it was lower than 1.3v).And I created my computer and I looked at it and it was nice :)But then I started to view benchmarks, assessments in syntetic tests and noticed that 9700k is faster than 8700k in most cases. It faster than 7820x in most scenarios but....But 9900k is much more faster in rendering, photo editing and streaming tasks. In two words, in those cases where multithreading takes place and all real cores + virtual cores are used at their 100%.And ... I made a decision to purchase 9900k.It's a costly investment but I thought I would sell my current X99 5820k computer + sell 9700k processor.It's as good as done.My 9900k was in my hands and....And only then I discovered from various reviews about bad VRMs out there for medium line ASUS Z390 boards.I was frustrated.How come?Why ASUS did so?Should I buy new motherboard now?My Z390 Prime-A is a medium line MB (in one line with Strix and maybe a little worse than Z390 Maximus Hero).I started to research and came to conclusion (having tons of sources in the net, including video reviews + comments to them, articles, reviews from community etc etc) that my ASUS Z390 Prime-A will be suffice for 9900k with moderate OC. To which extent - this is the question.Will I surrender or try?Am I a risky person?No I am not.But... how hard I wanted to try... I could not control myself and I did it.So... ASUS z390 Prime-A + 9900k + 32Gb 4x8 Corsair Vengence + Noctua D15 + PSU Corsair 650X + two more 140mm fans for my case (one for upper outtake and one additional for front intake)Thermal paste I applied to the processor is Arctic MX2Also, I must specifically note for people who will use the config. I used discreet graphics card (XFX RX 580), I did not use internal graphics. Maybe usage of internal graphics may cost you more in temperatures and wattage.When I first started my computer I entered BIOS andI STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO IT: TURN MCE OFF IN BIOS.This is the most important thing you can do.Why?Main reason to do so is the MCE puts very high default voltage to the processor.Then increase power limits:Long Duration Package Limit is 190WPackage power time window is 2secShort duration power limit is 220W.Current CPU capability is 170%CPU SVID support EnabledVRM Spread Spectrum DisabledSVID Behaviour Typical ScenarioIA AC and IA DC  load lines to 0.01CPU Load Line Level 5 (not sure this parameter works at all due to set previous ones to 0.01)VT-D enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)VMX enabled (ignore if you don't use virtual machines like VmWare or Virtualbox)Now, I played a lot with core multipliers and voltages and came to these results:Core mutlipliers for 2 first cores: 50Core mutlipliers for another 6 cores: 49Cache multiplier 43AVX offset: 3 (I strongly recommend to put this offset)Voltage: Adaptive (I know, many reviewers and commenters do not like adaptive voltage. I like it.)Adaptive Additional Turbo voltage 1.25Adaptive Offset : +0.015For memory I set XMP I profile (3200Ghz 16-18-18-36 2T)For your system these voltages may not be appropriate, all depends on your die's quality.Also I played a lot with offset for the Adaptive voltage (see below why).Now the system is ready to go.My ambient temperature in room is 22 CTests I used:1/ Prime95 Small FFT non-AVX version.30 minutes with 4900 on all cores.CPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 75 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 177W (max)2/ Prime 95 Small FFT AVX version30 minutes with 4600 on all coresCPU package temp (hottest core as usual): 76 CTotal power to processor according to hwInfo utility: 179W (max, though I notices some peaks to 181W rarely)Where I played the most was the Prime95 with AVX enabled.The issue was that some cores stopped intermittenly (one or two cores) during full load (in 5 minutes or even in 15 minutes).The community recommend to increase VCore a bit in that case.In the continuous process of playing with all this I came the above voltages.I suppose I could put 50 to all cores and 3 AVX offset and get 80 C temperatures but I did not do it as I don't like so high temps.Of course, with regular apps and even other stress testing apps like Cinebench, Realbench, Aida or Asus Exteme Tuning Utility you do not get those temps at all.I double you can actually load the processor that hard (16 threads with 100% load) with any regular app. Let alone for so continuous time...Also I tuned my fan curves so they spin at 90% when CPU temp goes upper than 65 C.So at high load even so super silent case like Fractal Design R4 is loud like a rocket.This all makes me conclude that all those talks about loose VRMs on these boards are no more than just talks.Of course I don't know for how long the processor + MB will last in my scenarios but it works nice so far (3 weeks) with regular loads: compilation, photo editing, virtual machines etc.From this point I can compare my old computer (Asus X99-E + 5820k overclocked to 4200Ghz) to this new one.Forgot to mention, by the way, I use NVME Samsung 960 EVO 500Gb drive in my system.On older one I used Samsung 860 EVO 500Gb.Everything runs faster, and works blaze faster on newer PC.The system with 5820k even OCed at 4200 was somewhat meditative at moments (maybe old Win7 OS with bunch of trash slowed it down or what).I will make additions to the review when I will have something to add.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,5.0 out of 5 starsKeep your expectations in check!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2019","First, I'd like to start off by saying gaming isn't my primary focus. I use my builds for work first, gaming second (a very close second). I've gone through 3 different CPU's in the past year. Started off with a I7-3960x, then to an I7-8700k, then to a I9-7900x, and then finally landed on the I9-9900k.Seeing as how Xeon's are out of the question both in price and practicality; higher end consumer chips are a good bargain for people like me. I work primarily with Autodesk Maya and use Arnold or V-Ray as my renderer of choice. So core count and freq are important to me. Since I focus on viewport performance, single threaded performance is paramount for me as it's key for great gaming as well. The 9900k does this beautifully. Logic would have dictated that the 8700k would have worked just fine....and it did but, those 6 cores really showed it's weakness when V-Ray rendered out particle simulations such as smoke. Thats when I figured I'd get the 7900x as it's got 10 cores and it should shred through renders; and it did but, I lost out on single threaded performance in viewport and while animating. So, intel released this bad boy; it seemed to good to be true and required me to lose pcie lanes and switch back to z series chipset. For me it was a worthwhile expenditure.Cinebench scores for me were the deciding factor. My 7900x ran a 2243 @ 4.5ghz on all cores (custom loop). The 8700k ran a 1400 -1500 on a dark rock pro 4 @ 4.7ghz on all cores. My 9900k @ 5ghz on all cores on a dark rock pro 4 ran a 2086. That was impressive to me; sure the temps were a bit uncomfortable for me as anything over 65c to me is close to tjunc (I know I'm dramatic) but, when I leave a render on for hours or even days I want the assurance knowing my build isn't going to fry. So backing down the 5ghz OC on the 9900k to 4.7ghz all core, I'm at a comfy 65-70c on AIR.The performance gain while working in viewport in maya is NOTICEABLE and worth the expenses. Most who purchase this CPU aren't doing my line of work and want it for gaming; at least from my research and for gaming. This CPU crushes anything I've thrown at it. I have this cpu paired with a EVGA 2080 Ti FTW3 in a Fractal Meshify C Mini and neither of my components have hit over 70c while gaming on my X34P on any game I've played at Max!Subnautica 144 hz Avg HIGH Preset/Filmic FilterGR Wildlands 100hz AVG Very HighOW 160Hz Avg Epic/100% ScaleBO4 140 hz Avg Very HighMHW 90 hz Avg High Preset (also MHW doesn't support 21:9 if anyone knows how to get it to please let me know)In closing:Pros --Exceptional single threaded performance for workstation and gaming loads-16 Core turbo 4.7ghz on air stable AF render performance in Arnold is Amazing!Cons --16 Pcie lanes-Gets a bit hot for my comfortFinal thoughts: Unfortunately technology isn't where we'd all like it to be right now. We want 24 Cores @ 7ghz no OC running at 30c on a hyper 212. So for now, keep your expectations in check understand what you're purchasing and you won't be disappointed.

XPS 8930 with oc,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020",This processor is not what I thought it would be. It is better than I could have imagined. First the packaging is awesome. Next it installed in my XPS 8930 very easily as I already had updated the bios for support. I enabled overclocking in bios and started it up. Instant first operation was 4700 mghz across all cores with dells basic oc. Now in the description the cpu states 5 ghz on one core. After downloading intel extreme tuning software I was able to quickly dial in a -.05 v core to drop the temp and bring all cores to 5 ghz. I saw an ad when debating this processor and they wanted 70$ more for across the board 5 ghz. Hmmm seems pretty shifty as this chip allowed immediate oc across all 8 cores. I am running this cpu with a EVGA aio cooler 120mm. Everywhere I read said it would not cool it and they were wrong. Although I don’t play many games that are too cpu dependent. The processor has yet to spike to 100% with about an hours worth of my version of gaming. Everything I open or play is instant and immaculate. Games that previously had a lot of tearing are crisp and spotless.  The cpu helped remove a bottleneck with my graphics card. I’d love to see this chip on a heftier motherboard in the future as my only issues with oc at 5 ghz are completely caused by the motherboard. Mostly high VRM temps and power throttling due to 4 pin tax. I played with it for quite some time and am able to maintain a continuous 4.89 ghz with no issues. I left 3 stars for value for the money because the cpu is very expensive.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Make sure you have a decent sized AIO water cooler or a super awesome amazing air cooler before attempting to overclock or push this chip.Performance wise my focus is purely gaming, and it eats games for breakfast. Playing at 100fps on brand new titles like Assassin's Creed Odyssey like it's nothing, plenty of headroom to spare. Barring any massive game changing development in the next few years (DDR5 ram er, maybe?) this should future proof you about as well as any chip could, probably 3 to 5 years depending on what next gen consoles launch with (Meaning if PS5 launches with 16 cores (very doubtful) that may become the standard for games and your 8 core 16 thread pc starts looking old hat (even more doubtful). ANYway, barring something totally left field like that, I can't see anything gaming wise this thing won't be able to devour for years to come.I'm satisfied with my purchase, and the price (bought at $530) IS high but doesn't bother me too much because they have a price point for most everyone, with 9700k, 9600k, 8700k, all more than capable of fantastic gaming performance at lower price points.Let's be clear, I'm of the opinion you don't buy this for gaming because you need it, you buy it because it's the best (mainstream) cpu out there, and because you feel future-proofed (maybe, possibly, you never know). I like knowing I've got tons of power to spare for that next big game coming next year. If you feel the same, then go for it, you'll likely love it. If you have budget constraints and need to choose between this or a great gpu, definitely prioritize the gpu and buy a 9700k, 9600k, or even the 8700k or 8600k depending on how much you have left.And also the packaging is pretty so you can display it and show it off to your friends.  0.o",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,5.0 out of 5 starsI9-9900K is suitable for use as workstation CPU,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2018","I9-9900K is suitable for use as workstation CPUIt took me a long time to receive the product. I mainly use it to do the creative work of animation special effects content, so I will focus more on this product.First of all: the 9th generation CPU can still be used on the Z370 motherboard (users need to update to the latest BIOS); but if the result you want is the pleasure of overclocking, it is recommended that you replace the high-end Z390 motherboard, or you use the very expensive Z370 motherboard (such as MSI's Z370 Godlike motherboard, which is super-high. The Z370 motherboard at the end provides better CPU power supply capability).Second: Although the 9th generation has replaced better thermal conductive materials, a set of radiators with good heat dissipation performance is still the preferred condition. When I do pre-crushing calculation or heavy load rendering, the temperature is still very high. Well, the radiator I use is the X61 of NZXT.Third: If users use ordinary Z370 motherboard, my personal suggestion is to work at the default frequency as far as possible. I have tried to test FPU in 5G state, and the motherboard will actively interrupt the process. I think the maximum power consumption has exceeded the capacity of the motherboard. Although this Z370 motherboard can let me another I7-9700K work at 5.1G frequency and pass various stability tests, but for I9-9900K 5G pressure, the motherboard is powerless.Fourth: The multi-threaded rendering score of I9-9900K test CineBench R15 at default frequency is about 2000 +, instant overclocking to 5G, and the score is only increased to 2100 +. The fever is not proportional to the increase of power consumption. In other words, the dividend of overclocking is far less surprising than expected, so I would personally suggest if It's a job requirement. By default, it has performed very well. It's not even different from the default frequency I9-7900X. Unless you're really a user who lives on overclocking, it's still a good way to use it by default.Fifth: If the purpose is simply to play games and get a higher number of game frames, it is more reasonable to invest in a high-end video card than to buy a CPU, or to use I7-8086K and I7-9700K, you will find that there is no obvious difference between them in the course of the game.Finally, I9-9900K is more suitable for building a primary workstation. It has good rendering ability and high frequency support for single-threaded computing. In this respect, I think this is a very good CPU. One of the screenshots is a test map, and the other is a screenshot of the working modeling status.Forgive my chattering and thank Amazon for his customer service efforts.

However, this thing is expensive considering it's place in the market amongst same or similar performing products.I had a Ryzen 3700x in hand before I chose the 9900K and I switched because there was very little to no overclocling headroom, too many hoops that had to be jumped through, and excessive thermal issues with the Ryzen die to deal with.  The 3700x performed very well out of the box and made for a snppy experience, but in the end it just wasn't for me.In came the 9900K and the MSI Meg Z390 Godlike with 32GB of Corsair 3600mhz Vengeance RGB Pro memory.  The first boot was a game changer and it has been changing the way I play my games ever since.  It's fast.  Very fast.  And low and behold it is highly customizable which means it's easy to overclock.At first I had it overclocked to the well saut after 5.0Ghz on all cores with a core voltage of 1.267 under full load and my temps sitting between 75-80c.  Then I started playing with the Ring Ratio and memory overclocking.  Now I'm sitting at 5.0Ghz all cores, 0 Avx offset, 4.7Ghz Ring Ratio, 4000mhz on the memory while still using it's cl18 timing and 1.36v, and higher than I'd like SA and IO Voltages at 1.280 and 1.200 respectively, all at 1.308v and the CPU hitting 85-90c under full load with synthetic benchmarks.  Gaming? Everything is a breeze and temps stay in the 50-65c range. Mind you I have this paired with an EVGA 2080 Ti Hybrid so I'm sure that has something to do with the gaming experience, but the high cpu usage games do seem to benefit greatly.Overall the pc seems to be much snappier and responsive and I'm a very happy customer.  I do see the 14nm process of this cpu needing an end as there is just no more room for improvement in the way of thermal efficiency.  This chip does run hot.  Very hot! Thus the 4 stars. I have it hiding under a Kraken x72 360mm AIO and it, similarly to the Ryzen 3700x, still gets toasty even at idle although not near as bad as the Amd chip.  With the Windows Balanced power plan and C1e enabled with C States the processor will idle between 33-40c depending on room temperature.  However it takes close to nothing for it to spike into the 50-60 range for a couple seconds at a time. With the Ultimate Power plan where it stays at 5.0Ghz all the time it still sits around 40c at idle and will occasionally hit 55c with a sudden 5-15% load depending on what it is.  I am using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut as my Tim of choice.  I may way WAY down the road try to lap the IHS on the die to make for a more even distribution of the CPU cooler but for now this processor is a win.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Then the day after Thanksgiving I'm made aware that my processor will be delivered on Tuesday, November 27, but let me bring you to tonight Sunday, November 25, I login to Amazon to order some random household items only to discover a message saying my processor will be delivered on Saturday, November 24. My heart starts pounding because naturally, I was awake all day yesterday and not once did I hear a delivery truck, knock at the door or a ring of my doorbell. My heart starts racing because we have had a rash of package thieves recently in our neighborhood, so I make my way up the stairs at 1130 at night to check and see if there was a package on my front doorstep, at first I don't see one but it turns out the Amazon delivery guy put the package behind one of the double doors. After I saw the package I breathed a small sigh of relief, at least I can say to myself thank goodness nobody took it. My next concern was actually opening the box and hoping that my Intel packaging was not broken like I have seen in some other Amazon reviews, they used a pretty big box and although they packaged it with air you could still hear something rattling around inside quite freely and that did worry me. I delicately brought the box into my bedroom and proceeded to open it with the precision of a surgeon making his first incision. I was perplexed when the first thing I saw was black, turns out the processor box itself was in a very nice soft black pouch (I guess they spare no expense when you start buying these higher end enthusiast grade CPUs). Much to my delight I'm one of the lucky ones and my packaging was not damaged in any way shape or form. This also makes me extremely happy because for $570 (after-tax) I now have one of the coolest futuristic looking product packages Intel has ever produced and my inner nerd wants to proudly display this on a pedestal because I think it's one of the coolest things I have ever seen, (I know I'm simple and easily amused LOL).I'll be upgrading from a Core I7 8700K using a Noctua NH D15 cooler and a recently purchased Z390 Taichi Ultimate paired with 32 GB of Trident Z RGB 3200 MHz DDR4 Samsung 960 Pro NVMe GTX 1070 8GB graphics card, among other assorted parts. I use my system for two main primary purposes gaming and video encoding with handbrake and Adobe Premiere. With an overclocked I7 8700K clocked at 5 GHz on all cores I average about 135 FPS when encoding a standard 720 x 480 resolution video. It will be very interesting to see what I'm able to achieve with the I9 9900K. I know it will not be that big of a jump coming from the 8700K but my current system is only about two months old, With the exception of my motherboard which I recently upgraded from a Z370 to a Z390 about two weeks ago, my previous system for the last four years was a 4790K so as much as I will be comparing my results between the 8700K and the 9900K what matters most to me is the difference in performance between the 4790K and the 9900K.For those that may be interested I will update this review when I have those numbers",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,"4.0 out of 5 starsSlow shipping, faster than CPU it replaced","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2018","Took a month to arrive so minus one star. Tempted to chop off another star because I expected to get 10nm by now. But they did well enough with this yet-another-14nm CPU. Let's all take a moment of silence as Moore's law is officially laid to rest. RIP.-Performs 40% to about 100% faster on all of my workloads than the 4-year old 6-core 22nm i7-5820K it replaced.-I9 consumes only a fraction of the power and less heat at low utilization compared to that old x99 chip.-Peaks at about 176 watts after 12 minutes of running P95 torture test. Temps briefly peak in low 80's for that dated and unrealistic test. (Motherboard maker monitoring software shows mid 70's, Intel software shows low 80's...)-Except for initial setup and testing, I don't manually overclock the 9900k since that would only give me about 3% more performance than I get running optimized with no power restrictions enabled (e.g. out of  Intel TDP spec, but the common default for these early Z390 boards). Just disable the throttles and enable auto for the voltage and stuff.-5.0 GHz for common few core load for long periods, and 4.7 GHz on all cores forever under heavy load (e.g P95) is what I'm seeing with the above config. I'm just using basic H115i PRO AIO cooling and have yet to see any workload force throttling to the official 3.6 GHz speeds.-Times have really changed since my hard core overclocking days 20 years ago. With throttles disabled, the CPU does exactly what I would want to achieve. It's organic overclocking virtually out of the box. Turbo boosts to workload optimized fantastic speeds when needed, reduces down to less than 25 watts TPD when not under stress even while still hitting 5.0 Ghz. I don't have to do any switching or adjustments between workloads. No distractions. Perfect!-Unlike the much more expensive xx99 chipsets, Z390 enables Intel onboard GPU with Quick Sync for better performance and lower CPU utilization/power consumption, which is something I have long missed for some of my workloads, one of which runs 24x7.-Seems to be a great price if you compare to x299 platform prices. Thanks to AMD's innovation, Intel is cannibalizing its own HEDT segment.It's marketed as a gaming CPU, but IMHO it's a great choice for workstation needs. There's a lot of frustration in the 12-year-old-at-heart gaming community with this chip. It's expensive for that market segment especially with prices inflateddue to the 14nm shortage, it lacks much innovation over last year's offering which upsets the frequent must-have-the-latest upgraders, and there's really not that much headroom for overclocking without industrial cooling equipment.If you have an older (3 years+) CPU and looking to rebuild your system and want to invest in a high performing chip at a comparably reasonable price (compared to x299/HEDT platform and adding in extra cost due to the 14nm supply shortage), I9-9900K is a fine choice that gives you the latest and greatest. It's a safe bet since Intel's 10nm performance chips are likely now a 2020 thing.If you want more value, get AMD's latest. We all owe AMD's innovation some gratitude for forcing Intel to offer this 8-core chip in this segment. Long live AMD.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I can run anything on one that the other runs, and the performance is sooooo similar I can't tell which is which.  Same exact GTX 1080 in both, same memory.  There is maybe a 20 second difference with the 9900K while rendering a massive video edit, but what's 5 minutes vs. 5 minutes 22 seconds.  For perspective, my Ryzen 1950x Threadripper build did it in 3 minutes 11 seconds, and costs about $50 more.  If that helps, great.  Personally, it serves no new purpose and has no advantages over the 8700K.Original review:I don't care about gaming, an i5 built right is plenty for that.  I do video/audio production, so in this case I see a difference over the i7 8700k I've been using.  BUT, I have a Ryzen 1950X Threadripper that noticeably outruns both (and a 6850K and a 5930K on X99 chripsets).  There is only a $20 difference between this i9 and the Threadripper now at other sellers, and I can't rationalize this processor.  Any recent processor can game just fine (mine's an 8600, rarely used), and this is certainly no better than that in real time.  I ran Shadow Of The Tomb Raider for a couple hours on one, then the other, couldn't tell ANY difference.  If you use the extra cores and have an i7 I'd recommend it.  My Z390 board auto OC'd  this to 5.0 out of the box, temps are better than tolerable with water cooling.  But, if you really are performance oriented (i.e. video, large project rendering, etc.) go with a Threadripper and keep an eye on AMD for the future as well.  They're working with 7nm chips already while Intel isn't even bringing 10nm to market yet.  I've been building for over 30 years now and haven't seen a shift like this before, so even I don't know what to expect.  This processor, however is not much of a leap forward in any respect... kinda like Nvidia and RTX.  More hype than performance, stop-gap rather than a step up.  I'll end up selling this one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The I9 clocked at 5ghz on all coores will overwhelm it though, which likely means you would need a 360mm AIO or more likely a custom loop to cool this beast. In truth, the factory setting of the Asus motherboard were such that the standard overclock provided by Intel (5ghz on 2 cores, 4.7ghz on all) was creating temperatures in the mid 90Cs, well above where I'd prefer.I hate water coolers, and think they are overhyped in general. Definitely not worth their risk. So, I set out to maximize the system performance manually and better control the heat. In the end I was able to dial the voltage down from the Asus default, and set the core speeds to incrementally decrease as more cores load up, but still be OC. I then setup adaptive vcore voltage to further reduce temps and hopefully increase the cpu lifespan. In the end I have 1 or 2 cores at 5.2ghz, 3 or 4 cores at 5.1ghz, 5 cores at 5.0ghz,6 cores at 4.9ghz, 7 at 4.8ghz and 8 cores at 4.7ghz. I use an AVX offset of -4.  At these settings using air cooling, it tests at about 80C at each core level. AVX tests at 86C max. This leaves some headroom in case room temp is above normal. The system idles in high 20Cs to low 30Cs. Normal gaming runs in mid 50Cs to mid 60Cs.I used hwinfo, cinebench 15, occt, and prime95 while dialing in my settings.In most games he sees it hitting 5.1ghz very often, only when a game uses a lot more cores does it drop.So, it's fast, but it will take some manual work to keep your temps in line.

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,5.0 out of 5 starsBest Gaming CPU IMO,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","When juxtaposing the 9900k and the 2700x, you'll find that the 2700x is $200 cheaper than the 9900k, but that $200 brings a lot more to the table than a nice blue cube thing and an empty wallet. When properly cooled, the 9900k does not exceed the 65C threshold when gaming at 5GHz. I personally use the Corsair LC240E AIO Water Cooler rated for CPUs up to 230W. Saw another review where they said the Maximus XI series motherboards can't OC this to 5GHz, but I found that to be false. On both of my Maximus XI Hero (WI-FI) boards, I was able to achieve 5GHz stable with different 9900ks too. I'm unsure to the exact power draw, but at intense moments it'll reach 175w. The case is nice too, but if you order from online there's a decent chance it'll arrive in more than one piece.Some people argue that the 2700x is a CPU that can battle head-on with the 9900k. That's false. Completely. In CS:GO, a both GPU and CPU dependant game, saw a 200fps increase when standing still and up to 150fps increase during the action. The multi-threaded CPU portion works well too, seeing little to no impact when running Spotify, Chrome, and CS:GO at the same time. Cost to performance wise, the 2700x is to die for, but I have my monitor running at 240Hz and I need to keep my frames above 240, and AMD's IPS can't keep up with that, so I'll have to stick with the 9900k.Pros-wicked fast-high chance of getting to 5GHz-cool case-bragging rights-integrated? graphics?

Con un overclock de 5.0 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.38 v, llega a tener picos de 75°c en battlefield 5 cuando más se está utilizando, esto tomando en cuanta que es invierno con una temperatura ambiente  baja. Con un overclock de 5.2 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.41v, la temperatura de base es de 52°c promedio con picos en battlefield 5 de hasta 85°c con los abanicos a 1300 rpm, ya que a esa velocidad no hacen tanto ruido, podría subirlos más, pero el ruido es demaciado alto.Tomando en cuanta varias cosas, como que el AIO es bastante bueno, el que use liquid metal en lugar de pasta térmica, y la baja temperatura ambiente, el procesador produce bastante calor y esa es una de las consideraciones principales que se tiene que tener si piensas comprar este procesador; en cuanto a su rendimiento, el procesador es muy bueno, es muy caro (540 dlls más taxes y envío en algunos casos), solo por el precio y el problema del sobrecalentamiento no le doy 5 estrellas.Para que tarjeta madre usar, recomendaría cualquiera que cueste más de 200 dlls, siempre y cuando no sea ASUS, ya que su tarjeta de 280 dlls es solo de 4 caras, mientras que las MOBOs de gigabyte de 200 dlls tienen 12 caras, así que evitar a ASUS en este caso sería la mejor opción.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,4.0 out of 5 starsExcellent CPU for gaming and computing,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019","I bought this fairly soon before AMD released their Ryzen 3 series, and admittedly, AMD's Ryzen 3 3900X sounds like a great processor for a similar price as the i9-9900K (the Ryzen has 4 more cores, 8 more threads, and sounds like it does well in benchmarks).  However, the Intel i9-9900K is a great processor.  With 8 cores and hyperthreading, the i9-9900K offers 16 threads, allowing many things to run simultaneously.  I have this processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super card (Asus ROG Strix) and a 4K monitor.  I've only played a couple games on it so far (Galactic Civilizations III and the Quake 2 RTX demo (for the Nvidia RTX 20-series cards), and they play smoothly at 4K (though the Quake 2 RTX demo seems more taxing and runs better at 1920x1080).I also sometimes run some distributed computing projects using BOINC, such as SETI@Home and World Community Grid.  SETI@Home tasks on this processor tend to take between about an hour and 15 minutes to 2 hours or so.  And with 16 threads available, BOINC will run 16 tasks at the same time, allowing plenty of work to be done.One downside of this CPU is that it can get fairly warm (from what I had read in other reviews).  I opted to get a liquid cooler for mine, a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Riig RGB 240mm.  Under a load (with BOINC), I've seen my CPU get to around 75C-81C.  When idle, I've seen mine at around 29-30C.I also sometimes do photo editing and video encoding, and this CPU helps get things done relatively quickly.Overall, this is a great workhorse CPU.",5.0 out of 5 stars

However it's just disappointing to see Intel not being able to crack the 14nm curse. This chip is basically pushing the limits of that architecture (skylake refresh). And be prepared to either get a beefy air cooler (Noctua U12s, D15, be quiet Dark Rock Pro 4) or a 360mm AiO or go full custom water cooling because this chip needs all the cooling it can get. It's HOT. VERY VERY hot.I have mine delidded (yes I delidded because the Intel STIM can't do anything to cool this CPU), and run it bare with no IHS with a direct die frame, and it's still very hot.Despite all the negative things I've said. This is a very fast chip, and if you have the money... 100% go for it. Especially if budget isn't an issue, and you want the best. Just seeing all 8 cores and 16 threads at 5.0ghz is a sight of beauty. Best part about this chip is, if you're a streamer you can choose between NVENC or x264. I'm able to run x264 in OBS on Fast preset, and I don't notice any hiccups. This chip is a champ.Hopefully Intel can bring us a little more next year, as it seems like they wont be releasing any mainstream desktop CPU's in 2019, and the only thing we'll be getting is a 9900KS (factory binned and overclocked at 5.0ghz on all 8 cores).",5.0 out of 5 stars

I side graded to this CPU from the Threadripper 1950x and instantly saw a HUGE performance increase in both games and the Adobe Suite. Even though it has half the cores/threads (of the threadripper), the way Intel engineers their chips, there is very low latency which is very important for gaming.I run this CPU in an Asus Maximus Hero XI mobo, works very well together.Keep in mind, if you plan to use this CPU, you’re going to need a very good cooler.  I recommend an AIO (all-in-one), I have the Corsair H100i V2.  Works well, I can overclock to 5ghz with no throttling.  If you’re going to use a fan block, you most likely won’t be able to hit 5ghz, go with an AIO if you can afford it.In terms of performance, I get over 150 FPS in most AAA games (on high settings) while using the 9900k with a 1080ti and 32gb of DDR4 3000mhz RAM.If you can afford it, I would go with the i9 9900k if you’re looking for a solid workstation/gaming pc hybrid.

I have an OC'd GTX 1070 that I thought was pretty fast, but am now finding it to be my performance bottleneck (Mind you, I came from an i7-4770K, so I wasn't spoiled yet). I'm running a Noctua NH-D15 with their two included NF-A15 fans to keep the CPU cool. For about $70-80, I was able to squeeze out a significant amount of power because of Noctua's incredible product line, without the leakage risk of running water cooling. Overall very pleased and would recommend to anyone in the market with a mid-high budget.Edit: Got my hands on a 4 pin EPS connector for the additional 4 pin on my mobo's CPU power connection and was able to manage 5.0GHz stable at 1.315V.

I am not a gamer, I use this for running scientific calculations -- these calculations run for a long time (hours at a time). I have tested this CPU under full load (all 16 threads being used), works well but it need a very good cooling solution.The first CPU fan (Thermaltake Contact Silent 12) caused overheating within minutes. The core temperature exceeded over 80 degrees Centigrade (C) and even showing at 100 degrees C (reported by lm_sensors in Linux). As a result,  the cores were being throttled significantly by the OS.After some research I got Noctua NH-D15 and it dropped the operating temprature in the range of 55-60 degrees C. This is using an open case and ambient room temperature is about 21-22 degrees. So not too bad.Overall, this CPU is good. Performs well so far in my usage.

Unless you use a high end motherboard capable of 160 watts to run all cores at the stock turbo 4.7 you will see much less performance when used on a motherboard that follows Intel's official power specification that limits the CPU at 95 watts, most games will run full speed with the 95 watt limit, but other tasks will throttle significantly.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bottom line if you buy this you won’t be disappointed, but if you want a really good CPU for production also and not just gaming I’d go with the new 3900x if you can find one it stock that is.

I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error.

I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell.

It is really expensive. I would expect it to be a good performance and good quality CPU and has good service, but it doesn't match my expectations. It is broken 10 days after I used it. My computer was certainly not able to open. After I google the issues and take it to a computer store, it seems like the CPU is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product. So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty  (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time.

Intel Core i7-7700K Desktop Processor 4 Cores up to 4.5 GHz Unlocked LGA 1151 100/200 Series 91W,5.0 out of 5 starsI wasn't sure if this was going to perform better than the i7-6700k but I really think it was ...,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2017","I upgraded from an FX-8320 to this CPU and it SCREAMS. For the cost, I wasn't sure if this was going to perform better than the i7-6700k but I really think it was worth it based on the increase in gaming quality I've seen. But even with the huge increase in performance, there have been some drawbacks, though somewhat minor in my opinion.I'm going to go ahead and mirror what about half the reviews I've seen here and on Newegg have said; it gets hot. Hotter than it really feels like it should. Some people haven't had issues and I think they've won the Silicon Lottery and I am very jealous of them. I, however, am a huge loser in the lottery I feel. With a Corsair H105 I'm seeing around 36-40C idle temps and at 100% load... Well I can't really tell how high up it can really go because when I fire up Prime95 with small FFT's the temps go straight up to 100C and I have to cancel the test within seconds. When running in-place FFT's I see around 77-80C. Now granted I HAVE had my H105 for around 3 years now so it's possible it's not having fun working with my motherboard or the pump is going bad and I do plan on replacing it soon, but in the mean time I really don't think these temps are normal at all. Part of the problem could be the mobo (GIGABYTE AORUS GA-Z270X-Gaming K7 Gaming Motherboard LGA1151 Intel Z270 2-Way SLI ATX DDR4 Motherboardfor reference) delivering too much power to the CPU, and some people have said that driver updates fix this problem and I really should have done that before this review so I will update later if that DOES fix it. Because of this issue I've been unable, out of fear, to overclock at all though I'm sure outside of stress tests I wouldn't have to worry about it overheating much while gaming or day to day use.The other issue I've had is also related to temperature. While idling I periodically would see vastly different temperatures on each core. And when I say vastly, I mean the difference between Core 0 being 35C and Core 1 being 65C. This would happen randomly when running programs OR idling and would lead to a huge annoyance; my case fans turning up to compensate for just a few seconds then winding down. Not the biggest annoyance but I've heard others talking about this and I believe I've found a solution. After disabling the onboard graphics, the mobo option to deliver power to it was still set on. Using the Gigabyte App Center utility Easy Tune I turned it down and am no longer seeing this issue, so yay for that.Overall I'm very pleased with this product, despite it's temp issues. These issues may seem huge but in all honesty I never see temps higher than 65C while doing anything other than stress tests and my problems could stem from mobo issues but none of these have caused me to regret my purchase. I struggle whether or not to rate this at 4 or 5 stars due to my issues, but mine aren't as extreme as I may have portrayed them and most others don't seem to be experiencing this level of temperature and that leads me to a solid 5 star review.",5.0 out of 5 stars

However, be warned that this processor does run warmer than some other CPU's I have had. I am saying this based on my setup alone having a water block on the CPU and using a very large case with 5 case fans and 4 additional fans on the radiators. I previously had theIntel Core i7-5930K Haswell-E 6-Core 3.5GHz LGA 2011-v3 140W Desktop Processor BX80648I75930Kwhich ran around 30-35 degrees Celsius on average with no high heat spikes, as cores where being used at 25-50% load (May all be because of it having 6 cores instead of 4).My case and fan setup:--- Case:Corsair Obsidian 900D CC-9011022-WW System Cabinet Tower (Black)--- Fans:Corsair ML120 Pro LED, Blue, 120mm Premium Magnetic Levitation Cooling Fan CO-9050043-WW.This processor, however, has heat spikes up into the 50-53 degrees Celsius range, with an average of 60 degrees Celsius for the whole CPU package when being stressed tested. I currently have a two water loops for my system, with one dedicated for CPU and the other for GPU. I keep this CPU cool withXSPC Raystorm D5 EX240 Water Cooling Kit, which uses pretty large diameter hosing-at least compared to the hosing on my GPU that uses EKWB. Due to the fact that I bought this CPU because i upgraded my motherboard, as my other died after year, I probably be moving to a custom loop by EKWB (As they make great products and have an easy to use 'Configuration Tool' for assisting with ALL the parts you need for your water cooling loop). One of the biggest reasons being my new motherboard has an already built in EKWB for the CPU Regulators, which i want to add to my CPU loop (MB:ASUS MAXIMUS IX FORMULA LGA1151 DDR4 DP HDMI M.2 Z270 ATX Motherboard). I even may add one of their water blocks for the RAM as they make a very nice and easy way to do so. Once I add my new loop, which will use a three 120mm fan radiator, i will update my review about my new average temperatures.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For the price there's no reason at all not to own it, and it's waayyy more performance than most will ever need or use.  Runs cool, but there's really not a lot more noticeable beyond what the 6700K can already do.  You don't ""need"" to upgrade if you have a 4790K or 6700K already, but this CPU handles over clocking easier than either of those if that's your intent. I'm running a tame 14% OC, but have had it up to 22% with power tweaks and water cooling.EDIT: I'm building a new one for myself, and chose to go with a 6800K for just a little more money than this chip.  Slower clock speed, but rated higher by every major player in the business.  This is still a superb chip, but limited in some ways (single core speed NOT being one of them!). The 6800k out-benched the 7700k,7740k,7800x and 7900x. Also (which I also have all of) the 6850K, 5930K, and 5820K.  If you need a dragster, this or the 7740K IS the CPU.

Is it worth it to run into issues down the line.The speed performance premium may be too high for some.Other ThoughtsConsider that I still run two i7 2600k systems I built in 2011 (running at 4.8Ghz) on Air Cooling, The stock speed of a i7 2600k is 3.4GHz - The i7-7700K runs at 4.2GHz and requires water cooling to  get to 5.1GHz. The headroom for increased speed considerably less then it was six years ago.ConclusionIf you've purchased or built a high end PC in the last two years for gaming, there may not be a lot on offer here. A GPU upgrade may deliver more tangible speed results.If you use applications that are CPU dependent 3D rendering or Video editing, this increase in speed is welcome.For gaming, nVidia/AMD GPU's play a bigger role on your gaming than CPU's once did.

But that's not a showstopper.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018","There is a lot of drama surrounding the temperature range of this CPU, so I thought I would chime in here. I did NOT delid the CPU, and refuse to. I am using it with a Cooler Master Elite 130, ASUS Z270-I, and Corsair H60.Fixing it to a standard clock (4.2GHz with turbo mode turned off, etc.), 2 hours of Prime95 with an AVX load pushes it to an absolute max of 85 degrees. 85 degrees is outrageous for all the CPUs we're used to, but it's actually perfectly fine for this one. Bear in mind that my idle temperatures are in the 30's.With a stable DDR4-3000 overclock, the same test hits an absolute maximum of 95 degrees. That's 5 degrees away from TJMax. Scary but bear in mind that this is an unrealistic load.With turbo mode and other optimizations turned on, and RAM at standard clock, absolute maximum was again 95 degrees. With a small, conservative setup like mine this is actually impressive. 4.5GHz without DDR4-3000? I'll take it.With DDR4-3000 and all the built-in optimizations turned on, I finally hit the TJMax of 100 degrees and experienced light throttling, but no lock-ups or freezing. Many of the old systems I built would simply freeze or shut down in this situation, but this CPU gracefully steps back from the dangerous temperatures. That said, as well as the fact that this stress test is a hilariously unrealistic load, some users might consider this configuration to be perfectly fine.So my recommendation? If you are like me and just need a fast CPU in a small case, adjust your motherboard to fix this thing to a standard clock. Aggressive overclocking inside a small case like mine is simply not feasible with this CPU if you need rock solidity. I did keep the RAM overclock though since that passed 10-hour stress tests without a hitch. Alternately, if you have a big case, definitely get a liquid cooler with a big radiator. An extra fan and bigger radiator would easily knock off 10-20 degrees from all the aforementioned tests. You'll read all over google that people delidded the CPU to get the performance they're looking for. Unless you have a small case like mine, I can't see why it's better to spend money on the delid kit than for a bigger, better cooler.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-7700K Desktop Processor 4 Cores up to 4.5 GHz Unlocked LGA 1151 100/200 Series 91W,4.0 out of 5 starsSwitched over to Kaby Lake Intel from AMD,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2017","Let me start by saying that I like AMD.  I have bought lots of their products over the years-- cpus, gpus, and more recently apus.  They've always had good price to performance ratio.  I want them to succeed; I want healthy competition with Intel.However, when my last PC rig (Phenom II x6 w/ Radeon 6970 from 2011) turned 6 years old this January it was time for an upgrade and Intel Skylake and the brand new Kabylake were the only shows in town.  Though I had bought some great Kaveri apus in recent years for budget 1080p HTPCs, AMD in general felt really stale and my most recent build had actually been an i3  skylake for a pfsense router.  But when the announcement of March release for Ryzen 7 came I certainly felt like I could wait another 60 days to see what the long awaited Ryzen offered.In short, what a disappointment.  My main rig is used for gaming, software development, and light video editing.  AMD kept claiming that Ryzen would go head to head with Intel's best and beat it with its price.  And, that's true if your use cases are multi-core with heavy graphics editing or various academic algorithms.  But it still fell short of the i7-7700k for single-threaded scenarios (which applies to many apps).  Sure, it's great that Ryzen performs as well as and costs half as much as a $1k Haswell but I was never going to spend a $1k on a CPU so that's neither here nor there.  What really bothered me was their highlighting of gaming benchmarks where the CPU wasn't the bottleneck.  Who cares if Ryzen 7 can perform as well as an i7 when the GPU is the bottleneck because you're gaming in 4k or 1440p?  Why would I pay $150 more for an 1800x that was inferior in many scenarios to the best i7?Furthermore, many professional reviewers easily found flaws with the Ryzen 7 (including a bizarre performance drop off at 1080p gaming).  When they brought those to the attention of AMD, they were told to disable features in the bios to improve things.  Disable features in my bios to improve performance?  WTF?  What kind of a weak response is that?  That shows a clear... no disturbing ... lack of preparedness on AMD's part to things that they had to have known professional reviewers were going to test.After having read a dozen or so professional reviews of Ryzen 7 all saying the same thing: 'looks promising but has warts and is clearly inferior to i7 in multiple use cases'.  I just couldn't pull the trigger on AMD.  They weren't ready.So, I took the safe route.  I went i7-7700k.  No regrets ... but godspeed to AMD and here's hoping they can get some real competition against Intel.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The CPU has High Frequency Clock and is a Beast when Gaming I did how ever had issues with XMP working with my Gigabyte Z170 Gaming 7 Motherboard but everything works as it should.3/6/2018This is the worst experience with Intel i had. I bought a Pentium one year to build a HTPC and had trouble of being slow, Then I bought this Core I7-7700k for a Gaming rig and payed ~$300 for, I had Buyer regret and was temped to sell this CPU and the supporting motherboard. then come to find out that Intel used bad thermal paste on the CPU die instead of using better quality thermal paste or go back to using soldering technology. Then hear that Intel had a Exploit with the management engine, Meltdown and spector that has been hidden for 20+ years and Found out Intel hid this information from the public for 6 month before releasing this information. and on top of that i never got my one question answered about the Die being crack or chip and what would have caused it when the CPU was operating with in spec. it was voided of warranty before i even thought of removing IHS, so i did not bother submitting a Request for RMA and just needed a answer so i would not let it happen again. I had nothing to lose when removing the IHS because Intel would have done the same thing to find why it was not working. That is why i stuck with AMD Processors for the last 6-8 years because they worked just the way they were design and fit my need and there Price to performance was more compelling then Intel processors. This has been the most disappointing company i have come crossed, Customer Service was too Focus on the Removal of the IHS instead of telling me what could of happen. There response to all this is to buy a new Intel Core I7-7700k for $300 sense i Physically damage the CPU by removing the heat spreader. I told them i was troubleshooting and it was the only thing left to prove it was the CPU and be hold i seen a crack burnt spot on the Die which i Deemed it to be Physical damage from the start. But this happened when i was working on a case design and forgot to plug in the CPU Fans when i was stress testing the CPU at Stock speed for Temp stability and found the temps getting up to 100C and thermal throttling. i plug the fans in and got it to cold down before the system quit working at mid 70C. Told them after i buy which ever processor, this will be my last Intel platform I buy and make sure that i would not recommend your enthusiast product to anyone. I also ask why did the CPU MAX TDP is set at 100C when usually limit it at a safe temp is 70-80C max to prevent stress on the CPU die from Rapid temperature change. Never got my $300 CPU support that i deserved.i need to say what i had to say, I Pray to God that things would improve before coming back to Intel.Update 3/7/2018 - I would not recommend this for inexperienced users who do not know about the Thermal Problem this will cause. When i Work AMD Processors they shut down if there was temps that exceeded a certain threshold. with Intel core I7-7700k it will thermal throttle under load and did not thermal shut down until the silicon blew a piece off. I just Now bought a AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, due to the problems With Intel cascading one after another. like i said it will be a long time before i ever come back to Intel. I was mainly a AMD Person and wanted to change but i guess this what happens when you change Platform.Update 3/9/2018, Intel did respond back as to why this happen are telling them that there Customer Support does not know how to do there jobs and there engineer do not know how to make safe products. They said that they were not designed to run with out fans( run Hot at 100C), and told me to throw away the broken CPU. I pretty much told them that in other word you only enable thermal throttling at 100C but disable Thermal shutdown? told them what a joke, Why should I buy the top of the line CPU that is Unlock and not have any safety features to make sure that customer don't make stupid mistakes. I guess this is why I never like intel CPU to begin with.If you have Read all this, Just to Sum this all Up, all K series CPU are ""Uses at your own risk"" and Have nothing short of absolute a water Cooling or Top of the Line Air Cooler heat sink. this is the end of my complete Review.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Prior to the Kaby Lake line, the only processor with this grade of performance is the 6900K (Price at time of posting: $1,029) and the 6950X (Price at time of posting: $1,628).Second of all, I'd like to mention the batch I got from Amazon is capable of 5.2ghz on liquid cooling. I was extremely surprised to win the silicon lottery. I honestly expected a lack luster batch from a retailer that doesnt publicize the batch numbers they have in stock.Next, I'd like to put a spotlight on the bad publicity for a minute. Perhaps it's because people expect groundbreaking flagship hardware innovation with each new generation. Moore's law states that the number of transistors on a circuit doubles every year. Similar to the public, Moore has some really damn higg expectations for the future. If a company fails to live up to these expectations, that's a valid reason to be upset with the company. My understanding is that these individuals who were upset about the 15% improvement, are letting their feelings torwards the company get in the way of their views of this product itself.Anyways, in my humble (not) opinion I am very happy with this purchase, and I will keep purchasing Intel chips until either Ryzen benchmarks high enough to make it worth the change, or until ARM takes over the world.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Naturally, replacing the failed disk turned into a full on upgrade of my entire computer.  I spent a lot of time researching processors, motherboards, and other components as I had not made a true change to my desktop for a good 6+ years.Initially, I was leaning toward AMD, as I had always done in the past.  However, I decided to swing Intels way for this upgrade, and I couldn’t be happier.  Stepping it up from an old Phenom II processor and a 2gb Radeon R7, to this beast coupled with MSI’s z270 Gaming M6 AC motherboard and their GTX 1080ti 11 GB Gaming X GPU, it has been an amazing difference.  I have yet to find a game (primary use of computer) that can slow it down, and as a “standard user” (ie I don’t really get into the specs in depth), I have seen zero issues.I’ve officially changed from AMD gear to Intel processors and nVidia GPUs and I don’t see going back at any point in the near future.

It's expensive but worth every penny if you are one with overclocking in mind. I would say that an amd chipset like a ryzen (comparable cost) is perhaps a little more bang for your buck, especially at higher resolution gaming but the intel I7 7700k does this as well and does it at a high level. One huge complaint with this chip is the heat. Now this issue comes only with overclocking. At stock speeds you might get heat jumps of 10c but generally it stays cool enough for this to not matter. If you plan on overclocking (why not) this is were I have seen temps that can become frustrating. A jump in temperatures of 10-15c when your temps are already elevated is not a desired thing. This CPU is better ran with liquid cooling to get its full potential and a lot of people buy the rockitt 88 kit to de lid their CPU to get a better TIM seal. This does void the warranty.

This is an unlocked chip. Mine OCs to 5Ghz no problem, but gets to, and stays at 100C with all the sensor tests I could find to run on it. Running anything even slightly CPU dependent will ramp those temps up, although not for long, they still get there. I've used Prime 95 both 26.6 and the latest version and they both bring the temps to 100C while load is creeping up to 10% in Real Temp.As for coolers so far I've used an EVO 212 and the Master Air Maker 8, which I returned because of the high temps my 7700k was achieving. While 5Ghz is a hefty OC and only 25% of chips are supposed to be stable at this OC, I am seeing numerous Youtube.com videos being produced where enthusiasts buy a $30 3-D printed Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) removal tool, remove the Thermal Interface Material (TIM) and replace it with something like the  $25 Cool Labs liquid metal applied in place of the stock TIM and replace the IHS. Doing this they are able to achieve 20C lower temps! That would put my CPU in safe range! Is that so much to ask for a $350 CPU? I guess it is 10 years later, when there are no competitors after paying Micheal Dell $1 Billion a year to exclusively use Intel CPUs.Edit: Temps with the DH-15 with 2 fans without noise reduction resistors.

On these chips Intel is using some pretty not that good thermal compound between the die and integrated heat spreader, meaning this thing gets hot! It'll also randomly Spike in temps at times (I've seen so far on mine a max spike of 20 degrees C!) Intel's response to this is that you shouldn't overclock even though you are paying the premium for it. From what I've seen the solution to these heat issues is delidding (which means voiding the hell out of your warranty) and replacing that poor thermal paste with some form of liquid metal (grizzly conductonaut is  one that seems to be the best). I haven't gotten a chance to overclock yet, (I need to get a new cooler). I'm currently running mine with Noctua l9x65, which isn't even recommended by noctua for this chip without good airflow and disabling something In bios, and I'm reaching temps between 82-87 C during prime 95 stress testing for 30 ish minutes. During gameplay in fallout4 with a gtx 1060 6gb with some heavy modding I reach about 71 max and fps stays at my 61 fps max cap  in most situations, EVEN in downtown area gunfights.TLDR: This is an alright chip at stock, but intel's premium price and lack of premium support (out right telling everyone not to overclock and poor IHS thermal compound  )  for an unlocked chip makes it hard to recommend.

I LOVE how powerful it is, but I do not understand why intel purposefully manufactured these chips with poor material. The thermal interface material houses so much heat. Chips that are delidded literally run minimum 20C cooler, some even cooler. And that's not an exaggeration.With AMD Ryzen 1700X being $50 more, about $390 compared to 7700k at $340, there is literally no reason to purchase a 7700k. If intel does not change their manufacturing process and provide a superior product that doesn't need to be delidded to actually run properly at a normal temperature, I will never buy intel again.At 4.6 ghz (0.1 ghz above stock 4.5 ghz) at the lowest vcore I could manage to run prime95, real bench, and cinebench stable for over 48 hours, my temperatures spiked to 88-91C and on average while gaming and streaming I run at about 80C. The cpu runs ridiculously hot while barely pushing an overclock on a top end cpu air cooler with good case ventilation. 4.5 ghz runs the chip at 70-75C. This is unacceptable for a top end product and benchmarks place AMD Ryzen far above the 7700k for both practical and theoretical uses. I didn't watercool, but if the product was made better, I shouldn't have to. Intel just lost a customer and will lose many more with its poor judgement in cheaping out on the thermal interface material.

Using a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO cooler, I couldn't get my i7 7700K to run below 90* C on all 4 cores when pushed with Prime95, even at stock clock (I didn't even try to clock it up due to the heat).  I've built many a PC in my career and I'm sure the cooler was mounted properly and my BIOS firmware was up to date.  Doing some googling, I see others having the same issue due to the TIM under the heat spreader.  Many people are ""de-lidding"" their 7700K's to replace the TIM (thermal interface material) with higher quality stuff and dropping 20*C under load.  Obviously, that would void the warranty and not a step that I'm willing to take, so this one was returned and I got a 6700K instead.  Using the same cooler, it remains in the high 60's or so (ambient at about 22*C) under load, even when I overclock it to the same speed as the 7700K (4.5 GHz).  The fact that the core temp would fluctuate rapidly and to such a great degree also caused the CPU & case fans to go nuts under normal working conditions - speeding up and slowing down quickly was very annoying.  Not so with the 6700K.  Perhaps I had a bad ""sample"" and didn't win the silicon lottery, but I'm glad I ""downgraded"" to the 6700K.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I paired it with a Corsair H100i v2 and expected to be able to achieve a 5GHz overclock, but those dreams were crushed by spikes well over 90C and a terrifying amount of thermal throttle. I couldn't even achieve a stable 4.8GHz clock without crazy thermals, so I ended up settling for 4.6GHz at a 1.255 Vcore. It still runs pretty hot with 36C at idle and 80C subject to Prime95, but at least it's stable and no longer throttles.

Been in service in my main workstation ever since then, and it shows no signs of stopping. I've had it paired with a Noctua NH-D14 cooler since Day 1 (the Intel stock cooler literally hasn't come out of the box in the nearly 7 years I've had it) and it's been a workhorse. It still holds its ground quite well, only obsoleted by the fact that nothing newer than an LGA1150-socket motherboard supports it.Powerful cooling is a *MUST* with Haswell, as these CPUs run HOT, especially under heavy AVX/AVX2 loading, as video rendering tends to do, hence the Noctua NH-D14. Regardless of the heatsink that you install on it, you need to ensure that the heatsink gets good, clean air.Overclocking is a bit of a delicate ballet with these CPUs, as well. YMMV, but I had to lock my ring voltage to 1.2 or 1.3V, ring frequency to 4000MHz, memory voltage to 1.35V, and then I set the FSB to 100MHz with a 46x multiplier. All power-saving states off, core voltage @ 1.250 or 1.255V, and it's stable under 100% all-core load in the form of intense AVX2 load by way of rendering x265/HEVC video @ 1080p60.Overall, an excellent chip that holds its ground very well, but has a few specific things to be aware of.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This chip is in 7 clients' builds yet today, because every time they ask about upgrading I bring them over and let them sit down in front of the newest and prettiest, be it the venerable 6850K, 5930K, 5820K, 6700K, 6800K, 7700K and now the 8700K (I'm not a fan of the i9's or X's).  Nothing I have is noticeably better all around than this CPU, period.  You can take the specs and wipe with them for all the difference you'll actually see in real life applications.  It's no fun to say that because I WANT to see a difference.  I can clock this thing to 4.7 on water with such a small adjustment in voltage it's crazy, and rise only 5-7 degrees C with a custom loop to idle at 38-40 degrees and run hot right around 50 (a little of it is due to my loops and 20+ years of building), but no other CPU I've used  reacts like that.  I own games.  I've never finished 95%  of them because to this day almost nothing taxes the CPU.  So I test with video editing.  4 cores and 8 threads is enough for any normal human, if you're a pro then you'll want something for an X99 or 2011/2066 board.The only cons are that this is going up in price and Z97 boards are harder to find new.  When I read that the 6700K, 7700K and 8700K are upgrades I just grin.  And why the 6 and 7 series were produced at all is nothing but marketing and little tweaks that aren't noticeable.  I have a Threadripper as well as all the above and more, and when you want to be stunned then see what all those cores are good at and compare THAT to Intel's consumer chips.  AMD's version of the Xeon is NOT great all around but the Intel folks aren't any smarter than the AMD developers, they only have deeper pockets to draw from and a longer history of doing the same thing the same way.  That's why the 4790K stands out...but until the 8700K I think Intel was just punching the clock.  It's a superb CPU that's NOT going down in price AT ALL because it's still so viable that the software has yet to catch up.  If it's used with the right board, with the right RAM and BIOS set the right way I'd still put it up against the 8700K built by 95% of the market that's buying them and getting their comparisons on their cell phones and shouting specs from the rooftops :-)  Next time just ask them how many Ghz to fill a gallon halfway?!!

You should also check your BIOS voltages, most OC websites recommend 1.2V for 4.4GHz to see about 6°C tem. drop without loss. This Processor will test 25°C bellow Maximum operating reported by Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool 64-bit, running at 86°C using Corsair Link to verify processor temperature. So I am assuming the maximum specified temperature, before forced shutdown, is at or about 110°C (I am a sensor error of +/-5°C). There are also articles Benchmarking the i7 4790K with all fans set to low and the processor runs at a constant 100°C with only none, or negligible loss. meaning, to burn this processor you would have to do something wrong, or it has to be defective in the first place. It was tested at factory, so defects should be minimal, only thing you have to worry about is shipping competency of the warehouse. Mine was shipped... OK, it works for now... though I can't get used to the high temperatures. I am using a H80i Corsair ... still seeing 80's on stress tests. Gaming, with good GPU, you won't see above 70's with stock cooler, with a 560 Ti I am seeing 77°C running Mass Effect 3, FireFall (72), Tom Clacy's Splinter Cell Black Ops(75°C)... it really depends on how efficiently they made their engines and how dependent they are on the processor, most FPS games are focused on using the monkey-house GPU rather than the brain-trust CPU.The only drawback is the heat. It will provide you with seamless performance across video compiling to HD gaming, and Autodesk/Solid Works project renderings. It can't be slowed down, let alone stopped.

Using the stock frequency and with the ""most heat"" setting of Prime95 stress tester my liquid cooling system is not able to keep up and it overheats.  Using the ""balanced"" setting of Prime95 it does fine.  This may not bode very well for overclocking, I may need to upgrade my cooling system.  I'm using a Corsair H60 120mm liquid cooler with Tuniq TX-4 ultra high performance thermal compound.  My previous CPU, an i5 4670K, did not come near overheating under the same conditions.  Since this i7 uses hyper threading on 4 cores for a total of 8 threads, along with the higher frequency, increases it's workload greatly.  I'm also not sure how well Prime95 really simulates actual conditions.  Nothing else I've thrown at it in normal usage causes an overheat.  More testing ahead.  The Amazon ""Prime only special"" price on this was nice too.Update:I updated to a 240mm water cooler and this CPU is now running much cooler even with some mild overclocking but it still cannot handle Prime95's ""most heat"" setting.  It immediately overheats.  I think that test may not reflect real world conditions.  Nothing else, even with some overclocking, comes near to overheating the CPU.  I don't know if the Prime95 application was written with this type of processor in mind.  So I will continue to test with a bit more overclocking and see what happens.  I won't test any further with that 'most heat' setting of Prime95. Otherwise this CPU has been working great, no problems at all.  With this CPU and an SSD boot drive Windows 10 boots almost instantly.Update:It was suggested that I try an older version of Prime95 to test (see comments) and it does work as it should with the older 26.6 version.  It runs at 68-70 C using the same settings that caused it to overheat with the later version.  Some internet research verifies this to be an issue between at least some of the latest Intel CPUs and the later Prime95 versions.  I had suspected it to be an issue with Prime 95 and apparently it is.

I finally couldn't say no to upgrading my old rig (an almost 6 year old AMD Athlon X3 [yeah that's right, triple core!])After graduating college I finally have a job that can afford me to build something a little nicer than a budget rig. So I splurged on this beast of a cpu and paired it with an ASUS Hero VII Z97 motherboard.To be real with you, the last time I built a rig I had a techie friend with me who kind of babied me through it. I didn't even have half the amount of money sunk into that setup as I do this one... so doing it friendless was terrifying.By that I mean my friend wasn't there. I have friends. I swear.I purchased a Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212 to slap on top and make an ""Arctic Silver 5"" sandwich. Can I just say there is something supremely horrifying about hearing the creek of a $200 motherboard as I tighten the screws on a heat sink over a $300 processor?Luckily, I did not destroy the setup. Turns out they build this stuff to survive the clumsy hands of a novice such as myself.I planned on overclocking this chip (or else why get the k?) but it's so darn fast right now I just don't feel motivated too. I'm enjoying a stock 4ghz hyper threaded quad-core CPU at an idle of 34-35 degrees and a load of about 60-65. Ran Prime95 and the chip would barely blip above 68 degrees.I truly couldn't be happier with this chip. I'm sure I'll eventually get crazy and start overclocking it... but I just can't think of a practical reason to overclock a chip that is so dang fast on it's own.Look, this is an expensive chip. But you get what you pay for with Intel. AMD is great for a budget rig, but I couldn't be happier with this purchase.I might be eating ramen noodles for dinner for the next month (they don't pay elementary school teachers that much) but at least I'll eat ramen while enjoying my computer time that much more.(Btw... this is unrelated. But add a dash of sriracha sauce to your ramen noodles. I was super impressed with the extra dash of flavor.)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Intel Core i7-4790K Processor (8M Cache, up to 4.40 GHz) BX80646I74790K",5.0 out of 5 starsArguably the best consumer-grade enthusiast CPU currently on the market.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2014","Can't recommend the 4790K enough. Coming from a non-biased view, it's amazing. I've owned both high-end AMD CPUs, older gen Intel i7s, and AMD GPUs, so I'm not stuck to one company over another, but the 4790 is the best processor I've had the pleasure of owning. The performance is just amazing. If you do a lot of video editing and want the speed for processor intense activities like rendering, CAD, etc., the power is there. For gaming and CPU intensive games, it has the speed so you're not being throttled and limited like you were with older generations i7s like my old Clarksfield i7-840QM. If a game you're playing is only utilizing a single core, the 1.87 GHz speed of that older i7 really kills you, but these new 4th generation i7s have all you need and then some, even if running off a single core. I have noticed some in the gaming community saying go with the i5-4670k as it's still good in performance, but cheaper and thus lets you spend more elsewhere. However I wouldn't recommend the i5, as spending a bit more up-front to future proof your computer so you save more down the road is always the better option, and the price difference is negligible. When I purchased this CPU on sale, the price difference between what I bought this for and what the lower-end 4670K costs, is less than I would of spent for a tank of gas.As a side note, as this is a K model and unlocked, it's made for overclocking. If you overclock, these overclock very well, but do tend to run a little hot over their previous iterations, so having a good aftermarket heat sink is a must (or watercooling if that's your thing). However, even if you don't overclock, having this model helps to future-proof your PC by allowing you to squeeze added performance out of the processor, and get you that much more use from your computer before you have to shove out more money for new parts. So I'd definitely recommend the K version even if you don't have immediate plans on overclocking.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Need Liquid Cooler!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2015","I reluctantly give this product 5 stars, not because there is anything wrong with the product itself, but instead because of the stock heatsink provided. It's horrible, to say the least.Upon booting my PC after installation the fan wound up, into what I can only imagine was the fastest RPM it could pull. During this wind up, it made the most horrible noise, as if a race car was driving through my house. Once it leveled out at roughly 37c, the fan lowered its RPM's, but it was still incredibly loud, I could hear it over the YouTube videos about replacement options for said fan.When I tried to run Rainbow Six: Siege, the CPU heated up to 105c, and averaged 100c. This was without any overclocking, 16gb RAM, and an R9 390x, plus 2 extra fans in my case.I realized that for any CPU usage, a air cooler just wouldn't do for this CPU. I immediately bought a Corsair Hydro H100i GTX. Upon installation/boot, I didn't hear a whisper of a noise. The CPU idles at around 27c, and running Rainbow Six: Siege/Assassin's Creed: Syndicate/GTA V/Fallout 4 (All on ultra settings) - the CPU never exceeded 60c, and idles around 55c for said games.So the product is incredible, it is what's on the box. The downside is, please do your research for a proper cooling solution that will fit your case. There is no way that the stock cooler will work in any condition at all, and it's literally pointless for them to include it.I debated on leaving 4 stars, because I feel that the product should be marketed in a way to let people know upfront that they will have to invest in a decent cooler (more expenses down the line) to get the product to function as intended.

One, The reviewers who had overheating issues had a bad cooling system; two, they're very bad at using the BIOS; three, I must have the most golden 4790K to hit the shelves.

I've never overclocked. It hits the thermal shutdown temp within seconds of any CPU stress test and powers off the PC. Went through 3 PSUs and 2 motherboards, reseated Noctua HS/F countless times. I also swapped memory four times, removed the video card, and did everything possible to try to diagnose and fix this.  I didn't even consider the CPU being bad a possibility, but I've now narrowed it down. There's a huge thread about this issue on the Intel support forums and Anandtech documented a manufacturing defect in their official review involving the adhesive pushing the heatspreader away from the die. This defect was present in Ivy Bridge as well and is due to Intel using adhesive instead of solder like on Sandy Bridge.This is the first computer that I didn't obsessively research every part for, guess that'll teach me.The system is quite stable and doesn't go above 70C except for stress tests or AVX workloads which explains why this issue isn't very well known.Intel support thread: https://communities.intel.com/thread/54032?start=0&tstart=0Anandtech review mentioning the defect: http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review-intel-core-i7-4790k-and-i5-4690kedit: I just tried a beta BIOS for my motherboard that was released a week ago and the problem is not as bad, but still extremely problematic. AVX stress test puts all cores at 96C+ within the first few seconds.  Still going ahead with the CPU RMA and hoping I get a better one this time. There are two elements to the problem:1. CPU runs hot due to heat spreader/die gap and crappy thermal compound in between heat spreader+die.2. Many motherboards are giving ""too much power"" but in reality Intel recommends turning down power levels to where the chip will sometimes not reach full speed during Turboboost, or for a reduced time.  Unacceptable.  This also makes overclocking all but impossible despite the product in question being a marked up K SKU.here's the guide from an Intel employee on the forums:https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23517He even warns against using XMP memory profiles to avoid overheating the CPU(at stock clocks/voltage??).  What a joke.  I appreciate his effort but Intel as a company needs to take some ownership here.  Sadly they likely never will, thanks to zero competition from AMD in the high-end CPU market and the processor working well enough for many people.I have a friend who works IT for a bank and he has this exact same issue but his issue played out in a very different but I suspect a more common way:He never tested the machine to see if it was stable and immediately overclocked with the assumption that a 212+ should be good enough cooling.  It wasn't stable but he chalked this up to the overclock.  It still crashes every week or so and sometimes during games but he's doing nothing to fix it.  I actually put all his motherboard settings back to default and did an AVX stress test.  It triggered the test's overheat alarm at 85C and failed the test within seconds, almost as bad as mine.  He has still done nothing to fix it and the computer is unstable to this day, months later.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Definitely overkill for a basic home user,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2015","I got the 4790K for my new build, replacing a 4.5 year old i5-2500K.  This is a pretty amazing processor; most likely overkill for a lot of users, but perfect for people who want the best.  For me, in day to day tasks, I can't really tell a huge difference between my old i5 and this. They're both rocket-fast paired with a SSD.  The difference shows, however, in a gaming environment. The only game I use is Flight Simulator X, which is a CPU-intensive title as compared to other games that rely more on GPU.  For Flight Sim, you get the fastest CPU you can afford if you want the best performance, and you can even skimp a bit on your video card. Although I set a fixed frame rate in Flight Sim, with it at unlimited I get in the 80s at ultra high (tweaked) settings, compared to the 60s with the i5.  Mind you this is with a less powerful video card - a GT740 SC 4GB DDR5 as opposed to a GTX650Ti.  The comparison isn't apples to apples, and would likely be a bit higher with the same card.  Closing words - if you are a gamer, and you want fast, get this. If you do other things that demand huge processing power, get this. If you're a home office user, you're overspending if you get this.

If you are incrementally upgrading your PC, this is the best deal going, period. Previously I was running an i5 2500k. In order to upgrade I had to purchase a new motherboard, owing to the 1150 vs 1151 cpu slot. But I was able to re-purpose my  (expensive) existing 16GB of RAM. Moving up to the next level of processor would have required replacing all of my DDR3 RAM with DDR4. And the MoBo's are more expensive. I figure it would have cost me an additional $400-$500 to realize maybe 10-15% faster performance. No brainer for me.I paired it with an ASUS MoBo, this one...ASUS ATX DDR3 2600 LGA 1150 Motherboards Z97-A/USB 3.1. This allowed me to easily leverage the overclocking potential of the chip. Using the auto OC function of the BIOS, I have been able to achieve Passmark scores in the 12000 range, basically the same as the $100 more expensive  i7-3930K (and don't forget the added costs).All in all I'm super happy with this CPU. Definitely spend the extra couple of bucks for this rather than the non-K version.

Nope, the poor thing was maxed out at 100% utilization and both my game and stream were dropping frames left and right even when using NVENC on my GPU to encode the stream video.So I bought this i7, overclocked it to 4.5GHz like my old CPU, and next time I streamed I had no trouble at all keeping 60FPS even during intense ship battles and large skeleton fights. Though the 4790k still only has 4 physical cores like the i5, the 8 virtual cores provided via hyperthreading made all the difference for juggling the intense workload incurred by streaming and keeping everything running smoothly.

This CPU is a real powerhouse both in speed and in processing capability. As this CPU runs pretty hot when fully loaded, anyone who uses this CPU to it's full capability will simply need to get another cooling solution beyond what is supplied in the Intel box, or you will experience thermal throttling due to the high temperatures generated. While this CPU can be easily overclocked by a Z97 Motherboard, it really does not have a lot of headroom for extreme overclocking. The current speed of 4.0 to 4.4 GHz is very fast as is. A really significant overclock to 4.8 GHz or better will require a serious investment in custom water cooling, or you have a very rare CPU. As for me, the CPU is fantastic at 4.4 GHz, and not sure I have a need to get any more speed out of it.

Runs warm when OC'ed.I have to say that overall I am extremely pleased with my i7 4790k purchase and it's performance. It is so incredibly fast, and is actually just a hair shy of a $500 i7 3930k in most tasks which says a lot.

I upgraded from an AMD FX-8350 in the summer of 2015. The frame jump was so high that I didn't even realize that I hadn't enable the SLI for the second GTX 970 that I bought along with it. When it sits almost idle, doing small things, it floats around 4.0-4.1GHz. BUT, when you put it under stress(like playing any game or benchmarking it), it jumps up to a stable 4.3GHz. I even saw it sit at 4.4GHz on one benchmark. And the included cooler did a good job of keeping the temp stable when I ran three benchmarks in a row on the 3DMark software too. The stock cooler is actually extremely quiet, also. I love this processor and recommend that you just eat the upfront cost. For the performance it gives, it's entirely worth the money. Combine this with a GTX 970 and you can just about max out Crysis 3 and Fallout 4 at 1080p. Just about. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I don't even plan on upgrading to the 6th gen 6700K whatsoever. I'll just put in another GPU. The performance difference is extremely minimal, and with the cost of the LGA1151 and DDR4 stuff, this is the better value.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Wattage was successfully reduced by lowering CPU Vcore to 1.150 Volts and  VRIN to 1.710 Volts.

I overclocked only a little but have more satisfactory temperatures at stock configuration of 4ghz base, 4.4ghz turbo which is plenty of power. If you are building an all new system go for the i7-7700k as it will be supported on newer motherboards with newer options like USB-C etc. If you already have a lga1150 motherboard and want to move up from an i3 or I5 this will be cheaper than adopting a whole new motherboard platform and you won't be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hard to say much more about it than that.My one complaint is that it runs VERY HOT with the stock fan/heat sink installed. Even without overclocking, the stock cooler couldn't keep it under 90-95C at full load, which is totally unacceptable. I reseated it and cleaned/reapplied thermal compound multiple times just to make sure it wasn't my mistake. A gigantic third party heat sink (Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO) brought the temperature down to about 65C, which seems to be about as good as it gets for this processor without liquid cooling. It's not a huge additional expense, but it makes me wonder why they include the stock cooler at all. It's just extra stuff to throw away, and I bet it could have been a few bucks cheaper without it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And the I7 3770K is great for this. Whilst only having 4 physical cores, it can be hyper-threaded into 8 cores. I had previously read that this wasnt as good as an 8 physical cored processor -as your probably have guessed, but I went ahead with my purchase.Instillation was relatively simple, but I was still neverous at placing the brackets back over - I didint want to damage a pin on a £250 CPU. But everything installed great! Please note, this does require 2x 6 pin power for the PSU.After instillation I done what any other self confessed geek would do; I jumped straight into my benchmark software. Firstly, I tried the Intel Burn Test -which isn't actually made by intel. This little piece of software seen all 8 threads jump up to 100% load and reached around 68 Degrees Celsius. On a after market Corsair H60 Cooler.I then used 3D Mark 11 and Vantage, unfortunately I do not have these results to share but the end result wasn't stunning but it was highly respectable.But I guess it more of a work load based thing. So I opened up my Sony Vegas Pro 12 (64 Bit) and started doing some video editing. The results were brillant! I edit in 1920x1080p full HD and the CPU was utilizing all threads for the work @ around 50-60%. I then rendered the video and the cores reached the expect 60-80% work load and raised to 50 Degrees Celsius. My 10 minute video was done in 7 minutes! I was astonished! I was previously using an AM3 AMD Phenom x4 955 BE and that took up to and hour for a similar piece!But for the gamers out there, I highly recommend this! It will be coming down in price and games will start to use those all importent threads within the next couple of years. Especially since the next gen consoles have up to 8 cores! You're really wanting a system that will run games brillantly. As I said, video editing wise this is dandy but in-games it's actually great! I play things like Shogun 2 and the recent Total War installments and the thing runs them great - I dont have any stats sorry,but It copes with any issues in 4v4 land battles at 50-60 FPS. Please note, I use a dedicated video card (GTX 570 2.5 GB).Overall,I love this CPU! It idles at around 30 Degrees for me and is clocked perfectly-I haven't tried O.C yet.

Die neuen Haswell kommen ja bald. Aber eigentlich sind die CPUs schnell genug, um Spiele zu zocken.Paar Eckdaten:Intel Core i7-3770k (Dritte Generation)Sockel 1155Geschwindigkeit: 3,5 GHz / 3,9 TurboBoostKerne: 4Vorsicht ist angebracht, bei der Wahl des Prozessors. Mehr GHz oder Mehr Kerne bedeuten nicht unbedingt, dass die Programme schneller laufen. Ein Programm profitiert nur dann von mehr kernen, wenn es dafür optimiert worden ist, ist er es nicht, dann gibt es nur dann einen Vorteil, wenn man viele Prozesse gleichzeitig laufen will. Dies ist bei Spielen in der Regel nicht so. Wenn man auf die Systemvorraussetzungen von Spielen guckt sieht man i.d.R. DualCore 2,4-3,2 GHz. Spiele profitieren also nicht unbedingt von den 4 Kernen, wenn man nicht unbedingt viele Hintergrundprozesse hat. Bei den Systemvorraussetzungen wird der Resourcenverbrauch des Betriebssystems schon mit eingerechnet. Wahrscheinlich auch eines Virenscanners.Mal ein Rechenbeispiel:Ich schreibe ein Programm optimiert für Single Core. Dieses Programm berechnet mathematische Formeln. Auf einem Vierkern CPU a 2,4 GHz wird dieses Programm langsamer laufen als auf einem DualCore 3 GHz (OS und Hintergrundprozesse verwenden den 2ten Kern). Ein Programm was aber die Kerne ausnutzen kann wird auf den Vierkerner besser laufen. Man kann Single-Core Prozesse nicht Multicore machen.Dieser CPU wird lange noch aktuell bleiben, denn für Spiele ist die GPU (also Grafikkarte wesentlich wichtiger sein). Deshalb finde ich Gaming Laptops auch nicht berauschend, da man dort i.d.R. die Grafikkarte nicht wechseln kann und somit das komplette Gerät wechselt, obwohl nur die Grafikkarte neu benötigt würde.Mit freundlichen Grüßen",5.0 out of 5 stars

I am very happy with the new specs and built in graphics handling. Coupled with my ASUS sabertooth Z77 this combination is amazing. The downside is the bundled cooler/fan. I cannot stress how important it is to swap it out ASAP with an alternative. With a CM Hyper 212  evo instead I am getting over 10° cooler chip on idle more even please do this immediately. The fan caused errors on initial boot and sometimes simply stalled causing great stress and worry about leaving the machine on alone. Since swapping out the cooler I have had no troubles whatsoever.

It will even play some  AAA and more demanding 3D games at low and medium settings, just do not expect it to knock your socks off.For tasks like video encoding this i7 has a noticeable performance advantage over the Sandy Bridge 2600K and the Ivy Bridge 3570K, in summery if you want/need an Intel Ivy Bridge chip this is everything you could ask for.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Come build day after dropping it in, I decided not to use the stock cooler because I'd heard these babies can run hot under load and that stock cooler doesn't look upto much, so I decided to buy a Corsair H60i water cooler to run the cooling side of things while I'm powergaming or whatever.Finally got to my new windows and the performance of this thing (at stock speeds even) is still staggering, I've been on the PC all night doing things and it hasen't broken a sweat once.

Admittedly it isn't as fast as a Xeon, it was never going to be, but its not as far off as I had first thought.I haven't tried overclocking this yet, but it idles at 1600mhz for most tasks, it only every changes when I start animating or modelling in 3D applications. The Intel Turbo Boost feature confuses me slightly, the CPU never seems to run at its described 3.5ghz, always shooting up to its 'Turbo Boost' levels of 3.9ghz, which I thought would have been reserved for only the most intense of operations.Ultimately, you can't go far wrong with this CPU, unless you work for Pixar and need the most powerful machine known to man, this will be more than good enough for anybody's needs, especially if you don't want to fork out for the i7 extreme or Xeon CPU's.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It is also marginally faster at the same clock speed.The other reason to chose 3770K over the newer one was the slightly lower price for the motherboard and the CPU itself.I was not disappointed and the processor passed an 8 hour Prime95 stability test at 4.5 GHz and 1,176V. The temperatures were in the upper 60’s C with my SilverArrow cooler which is perfectly acceptable.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Upgrade for OEM Prebuilt PC's with 4th Gen Intel Processors,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2019","Bought one of these used for about $180 to upgrade from the Intel Core i5-4430 that came with my HP Envy 700-074.  Not the best value on the market compared to the Ryzen 5 2400G or 3400G, but offers similar performance to those CPU's.  At the time of this review, those are much better values for building new PC's and include an upgrade path to CPU's with more cores, something that isn't doable with older Intel consumer platforms.The additional clock speed and hyperthreading definitely allow for snappier and smoother performance.  Gaming performance is improved massively compared to the i5-4430 when it comes to the latest AAA games, with a 15-30 percent improvement in performance in older games that have little use for more than four threads.Installing it was easy.  All it involved was swapping out the i5-4430 and inserting this CPU in its place along with a fresh application of thermal paste and reusing the original OEM HP cooler.  It runs slightly hotter than the i5, but temps stayed below 70c even under intensive testing.  Overall, I am very pleased with this processor.The i7-4790k was still over $200 at the time I did the upgrade, and that would have been the CPU I would have gone for had it been closer to the non-K version in price due to its additional performance.September 2020 Update: The PC this went in has been retired as of June 2020, but I enjoyed the short time I had it with this processor.  My only regret is that I purchased the processor near the tail end of the HP Envy 700-074's useful life.  I have since replaced it with a Ryzen 5 3600-based iBUYPOWER prebuilt, and I'm enjoying it as much as I enjoyed the Envy 700-074 in its early days of use in the fall of 2013.",4.0 out of 5 stars

When I build my new machine in July 2014, I did lots of research on boards and chips, looking at power, performance and cost.  This chip is an excellent upgrade for people replacing systems that are a few years old.  I upgraded from an AMD based platform and needed some serious speed gain for my editing needs, as the software has become heavier and heavier.I landed on the i7-4790.  Didnt spend the extra money for the K version, because I am using this for real world apps, and dont play games at all (dont have the spare time).I ditched the factory Intel CPU cooler and went with a CoolerMaster EVO 212, after reading several other reviews on it, where in their tests it was keeping the chip cooler than water cooled setups.All in all, I am in love with this new setup.BUILD Sheet:Case: Corsair Carbide 300R Black - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006I2H0YSCPU: Intel i7-4790 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J56YSLMCPU Cooler: Cooler Master 212 EVO - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXIMotherBoard: ASUS Sabertooth Z97 Mk II - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K2R6E10Additional Case Fan: Noctua NF-A14 PWM - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CP6QLY62x of Memory: Corsair Vengance DDR3 1600 (CMZGX3M2A1600C10R) - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008E3M4QSVideo: EVGA GeForce GTX760 ACX (02G-P4-2765-KR) http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E0N49C8WiFi NIC: Rosewill RNWD-N9003PCe - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009VKON0SPower Supply (PSU): Corsair CX750 http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RJZQSWBoot Drive (SSD for OS and Apps): Samsung EVO840 250GB http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LMXBOP44x of Hard Drives (2 were re-used): WD Green 3TB http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RORMF6CD/DVD/BluRay Drive (reused): Pioneer BCD-207DBK http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I47O7AKAdditional Items:WiFi Router: TP-Link Archer C9 - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PDLRHFWColor Correction Tool: ColorMunki Display - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055MBQOMMonitors (re-used): 2x Acer 23"" 16:9 (next thing to be updated)",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,1.0 out of 5 starsIt was just the wrong product,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2016","I'm sure that if you get an i7-4790 processor, any customer, gamer and worker alike would love the product. However, I had a wonderfully odd experience with this product. The core came in the proper packaging, undamaged, installed perfectly fine. The actually writing on the core was indeed i7-4790, so everything stated this was the right product. Make sure you check what you have after getting your pc running. I made that mistake. Despite everything saying that this was an i7, and feeling comfortable making that purchase, the actually core, despite all the writing and packaging is actually a pentium g3258. I don't know what went wrong, but when I started downloading more taxing games like the recent gears of war, and titan fall 2, the games wouldn't run, even though an i7 should be perfect. Turns out I've had a pentium in disguise this whole time. Good times. Amazon has been helpful, saying that they'll provide a partial refund for the product, and I understand that, but just a word of warning if you purchase this. I think I might be the only one this has happened to so no worries. I ran AMD before all this and never had this type of problem, so maybe it was just a freak accident on intel's manufacturing end. Cool. I'm suffering for my errors now, just don't make the same mistake as me and believe all of the wordings on your packaging and processor. It might just be wrong.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,5.0 out of 5 starsHardest To Install But That's My Fault.....,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2016","I decided to get this CPU as the i7-4790k I had just got wasn't stable on my system. It might run fine for two days then lockup solid or it might not even stay up for 20 minutes before locking up. I tried a number of things that just didn't work for me. Since I like my CPUs to run stable most of the time, this  was just not for me. (If I ever get a new MB that's set up for overclocking, then I'm all set.) So I got this in today and shut down the my main gaming system and proceeded to get it installed. Right off the bat yellow blinking light on boot. I had taken all the steps I should but no dice first try. Redid the heat sink compound and reseated the H60 heat sink on the CPU.....Second attempt.....yellow blinking power light. Decided to check and see if the PS, MB, or CPU were bad. Took the old i5 and reinstalled it and it booted right up! Opps! I was beginning to think I'd got a bad chip. So back to the kitchen for one last try. This time I removed the BIOS battery to clear he BIOS just in case. When I had removed i5 and started to installed the i7 again, I noticed on the bottom some heat sink compound has gotten smeared over the very lower left side of the chip on a few contact points. Apparently when I installed it the first time, I had gotten some heat sink compound on the underside of the chip. Cleaned that area off with some alcohol then reinstalled it  again making sure to get the compound on the top of the chip only. Put the battery back in and back to the computer room. This time the system had the yellow blinking light again on the first try. So I decided let's give it one more try. Pressed the power bottom and just let it sit there. It went thru a number of quick false starts and then booted right up! I almost fell out of the chair. I had just about decided I had played chip roulette once to many times. Anyway, after that it has been running very stable and has failed to handle anything I've thrown at it. We'll see how it does over a long term but it is sure running and feeling solid now. Guess next time I'll be a bit more careful with the heat sink compound! (Reminds me of my 4790k..........)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,3.0 out of 5 starsCHIP IS GREAT BUT THE COOLER IS CRAP AND DONT FIT BUT NONE OF THE RECOMENDED ONES WILL FIT IN MY CASE!! HELP,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2016","Well for starters the stock intel cooler unit and its stupid plastic push pins wouldnt fit my hp pavilion 500-223w. memphis-S motherboard. Which clearly lists this CPU upgrade as compatible. My board has screw threading in the holes so the push pins wouldnt fit. So i just put the chip in the board with the cooler/fan it came with. which by the way was twice the size of the one that came with this cpu. the only difference was the copper plating that was on the stock intel cooler and mine was from an i3-4130 so it was all aluminum. but i was a little worried about the temps getting up to 60c while playing an old assassins creed game which isnt even a really power hungry game, and so ive been on a mission trying to find a new cooler for this that will fit into my HP pavilion case. its been all but impossible to find a good enough one that can fit without the heatsink being like 9 inches long (like the hyper 212 evo thats recomended with this) and i only have a square 6 inch radius space left inside my case where the cooler should be. so i figured id take my computer apart to see what these screw threadings were. I didnt know if the threadings were just in the holes or if it was a bracket. so when I took the whole entire computer apart just to get under the board and see what it was, i found a bracket in the back that has 3 screws which are whats holding the cpu mount and when i tried to take the bracket off I realized that I couldnt because without that, the clamps have nothing to stick to. so I tried to reverse it because the bracket has this huge indent groove on one side and a straight smooth side on the other. the smooth side is whats screwed to against the board. so i attempted to flip it around to where the indent was against the motherboard so i could still screw in the cpu mount clamps but also have enough room for the stock intel coolers pushpins into. which worked! but sadly after i put everything back together my computer wouldnt turn on right away i had to hold the power button down for it turn on then it went right to the start up repair in windows 10 and said it didnt recognize the cpu fan and then restarted and booted and as soon as windows loaded i went to click the intel gadget tool to check what the temp was, and it would just freeze all up and id have to restart it and try again i tried about 4 times before i just quit and reinstalled my original cooler and now everything is fine again as it was before i did all of this.. but still i have NO IDEA what im going to do about this issue. I almost wish i wouldve known this would be a problem before i went and spent $1200 upgrading this god awful PC that I bought at walmart over the last year.(I didnt know as much as i do now about computer and gradually upgrading each component one at a time, PSU, GPU, RAM, now the CPU. pretty much everything but the board its self) I wish I wouldve just bought the right stuff from the jump before buying this OEM crap! Cause i probably wouldnt be here. but at the time it seemed like a really good PC to me compared to my last one. Now im stuck with it and i went as far as buying this 300$  processor and now i have no way to fit the proper cooler in it and i cant use the one intel gave me with it because of the stupid push pins that wont fit. I guess next im going to have to buy a new case. Well gee i might as well just go buy a new motherboard and new version of windows and just put all the crap this computer came with back into it and use all the upgraded stuff on a completely new build!!!!!! And when i called HP for advice for the FIRST time in the whole year ive had this computer and never needed them for anything, they had the nerve to tell me that because i removed the CPU and other stock components that my warranty is now VOID!!!!! WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THAT?! Smh.. I really cant win man. So now im stuck here wishing i wouldve just listened to one of my friends who told me to just build the PC myself from the start and I couldve avoided all of this. I just wish I didnt have so much limitation on what i could upgrade. Like my GPU i bought specifically to fit that CPU at the time cause i didnt think i would get a new CPU. Now when i go to get a new CPU i was limited to what i could choose cause it had to be FOR THAT HP BOARD. So this does suck. I guess it is what it is. Im just going to have to deal with it. I just have no clue how long this chip is going to last  now that i dont have the proper cooling for it. What a wasteeee. But so far the chip has been AWESOME at the CPU%!!! With apps and games that used to run my old i3 at 90% CPU, now barely puts a dent into this one! Even GTA 5 was only using about 20-30% CPU in task manager! THATS CRAZY my old cpu would be at a constant 99% while playing it lol.. So as far as the CHIP ITS SELF, ITS GREAT!!!!!! But only if you can maintain it with the proper cooler and board. Otherwise youll end up like me and spending a lot of money on something that you couldve put towards getting something better.. IF ANYONE CAN HELP OR ASSIST ME WITH SOME IDEAS PLEASE LET ME KNOW IM STUMPED ON WHAT KIND OF COOLER I CAN GET FOR THIS!!!! The first picture is the cooler that comes with this chip. and the second one is what came with my computer that im forced to use. If anyone has any ideas on what else i could get dont hesitate to respond!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,5.0 out of 5 starsA Very Pricey Processor...But Worth The Money,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2014","Intel Core i7 processors can be quite pricey; at least I consider processors within the $300 price range to be pricey. But if you're looking to build a computer that will operate in the long run (and use up less Wattage), Intel would be your best bet. I'm using this processor for a gaming computer, but I anticipate doing video editing (some time in the future...I think).But even if I weren't doing video editing (I keep reading that Intel processors are recommend for that), I also intended my computer to be a reliable workstation, in addition to playing games. This processor is so friggin' fast.I'll grant that even for basic work, it's over-powered, but I'd rather have that than under-powered. Hopefully, this processor will last in the long run.Be aware, though, that this processor is not accompanied with a ""K"" (an indicator that it is unlocked for overclocking). Nevertheless, I didn't see any need to overclock, even for playing computation-intensive games like Crysis. (The Graphics Card would be the determinant factor...I think.)P. S.: The Intel Stock Cooling Fan that came with the processor is quite reliable...and...I think quiet. (It's brand new.) I could tell because I was using silent Enermax fans. So far, it has had no problems since three weeks go when it was installed into my system. Unless you're into overclocking, this cooling fan should be adequate...maybe a little more than adequate for the job. It's quite easy to install because it's got it's own thermal paste installed on the heatsink base; if you're not sure how to install it, do a dry run because if you installed it wrong, you have to clean off the paste and re-apply it again. Do a dry-run installation to avoid the hassle; but if there's a plastic covering, be sure to remove it before installation.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Gaming rig built!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2015","Blazing fast at a great price.I've been waiting to upgrade to a new PC after my current one had been going on 6 years strong of hardcore gaming with it. It was time for an upgrade finally.After pouring over reviews on components, when Amazon offered this chip for a great price during a sale, I couldn't refuse. I immediately placed an order and the rest of my parts followed shortly thru various other sites.Let me tell you, if you want to run the current crop of games on Ultra settings, simply pair this CPU up with a solid motherboard, at least 16gb of memory, and no less than a Nvidia 970GTX. I say this because this is the essential meat to my gaming rig I just built and it's what I'm running all the latest games at.I won't go into further tech information of what I'm running unless you want to ask me later, but for the money of this CPU paired up with solid components around it, it can't be beat for the price.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-4790 Processor - BX80646I74790,"4.0 out of 5 starsGreat CPU, crappy cooler -- Get yourself an aftermarket cooler!","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2016","I know what you must be thinking:  4 stars?  That CPU is a beast (even if it can't overclock).  And you would be right, this is a strong and efficient CPU, which made me glad that I passed up an FX series chip/board and went the extra for this instead.  But I'm not just rating the CPU with this review -- I'm rating the CPU and the cooler that came with it (the entire purchase).This CPU is paired with an MSI PC Mate Z97 board, with the boot/OS drive on an ADATA SSD.  From power-on to sign-in is about 5-6 seconds for me (faster than my Chromebook, which can be usable in about 6-8 seconds from a cold start).  The start-up configuration that I have is similar to what I have set up for others.  I can multitask like a villain and not even blink an eye (music or YouTube, image manipulation, video rendering, streaming).But then we come to the included cooler.  It sucks.  The downside to my multitasking adventures is that my CPU does run up into the mid to high 60's (in C) easily, and frequently dips into the 70's.  That's not acceptable in a room that is deliberately kept 5 degrees cooler than the rest of the house (rest of the house is set for 69 F).  There are no obstructions around the PC case, and I have numerous fans on the case to ensure adequate ventilation.  I've noted from others who own the same CPU that they had to go with an aftermarket cooler for better temps.  I will shortly be doing the same.  For this, and only this issue, this product loses a star.Overall, I am happy with the performance of the i7-4790, and would recommend it to anyone who isn't interested in overclocking, but needs the ability to smoothly multitask.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel is the best. This will mostly be used for gaming and some video editing/rendering. I'm shocked to discover even this CPU isn't enough for the most extreme gaming. You should get something like the i7-5820K for 100% ultra gaming. This CPU can handle most games totally maxed, but not all. I already found two games that need more. I know it's a CPU bottleneck because the system has 16GB RAM and a GTX 980 Ti. It has to be the CPU. Game devs seem to sometimes put unrealistic settings in games that the average gamer's rig can't handle. The good news is both times it was optional to crank the settings that high. The games look amazing and run great turning the crazy setting down a tad. This is how PC gaming is. ha",5.0 out of 5 stars

I paired it to an MSI Z97-G41 PC MATE and can say it has an unusable amount of power. The speed it does find when it needs it is beyond what my mind can comprehend. And the turbo is wicked cool.It runs much hotter than my i3. It's not any louder. I will definitely be buying another.Though MSI provided no drivers this proc runs XP fine. Passmark scoring a 32-bit typical 7,600 down from a 64-bit typical 10,600 on win8.1coreN. Both running 32-bit apps at the same speed. So I run XP exclusively on this cpu with generic drivers.

The plastic push pins are very difficult to get engaged correctly.  They're also just long enough to prevent the heatsink from making good contact with the CPU, as evidenced by the poorly distributed thermal paste after uninstalling.  At start-up the temp hit 100°C and settled in the mid 70s at idle, and after running a game for a couple minutes the temp was up to 108°C, so the whole kit had to be removed.

That said, Intel may deny a return on any failed ""K"" series processor due to the possibility of end user foul-up.(B)Unless you are a the ""Sheldon Cooper"" type, the minor difference in native speed between the I7-3770 and I7-3770K is not noticeable for common tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets, databases, speech recognition, video playback and 3D games. With my system, video / audio / photo editing and production are optimal and I have yet to get a lockup when multitasking between as many as a dozen apps.(C)If 70% of your use and need is purely to ""game"" then go with any of the Intel I5 series. This I7 CPU is excellent for games but why spend the extra if you do not have the constant need for it? The CPU does count but gamers get the most bang for their bucks via a higher end video cards.(Heat issue fears with the IVY series)Overheating has only been a reported problem for those who overclock the ""K"" series and/or build and operate their systems poorly.Get a well vented case, good fans and CPU cooler, keep things clean of dust and hair and for God's sake don't operate in a 100+degree environment and you should be okay.(My build)I7-3770 CPUCorsair Hydro H60 CPU cooler (*Fan setup | interior-> (120mm push)->[HYDRO RADIATOR]->(120mm pull)-> exhaust from case)ASUS P8Z77-V Motherboard (*BIOS downloaded from ASUS and updated during 2nd test boot to fully support IVY bridge processor.)16GB G.SKILL Model F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL DDR-3 1600 RAM (*2 sets)SAMSUNG 830 series SSD as Primary Boot & Apps drive (*Firmware updated)Western Digital Black 1TB SATA III HDDXFX RADON HD 6870 1GB GPU video card (*using Microsoft Drivers)Rosewill HIVE 650 PSU.

Price was greatly reduced too but performance was ...,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2015","I initially only wanted an entry level Intel Core i7 for our upgraded desktop since I found out that the technician, who custom-built our PC somewhat cheated us as to parts for a price of $1300 in early spring of 2011. This after I looked at the specs when I started noticing that our PC started hanging and rebooting for no reason while in use. So late last year I came up with a plan to upgrade it; after all, I was building my son's gaming PC so it would make no sense to me to build his with the latest specs while I watch my own custom PC wither away just because I trusted an a__hole to get it done for me. At that point last year I was no longer a computer ""dinosaur'. I invested enough time reading gaming PC websites and had become confident that with proper timing, without compromising the latest specs as being outdated by the time I was done with my son's PC, to be able to make out my own version of custom gaming PC. This was how I stumbled in this product. Remember, I initially said that I only wanted an entry level Intel Core i7 processor in place of the lowly Intel Core i3 2100 that my cheating tech installed. Regardless of the replacement issues, I finally got to test it with the rest of the upgraded specs, using a 2011 motherboard which was forward compatible with what I have managed to scrap. Bam!!! Worked right away. I only need to flash the mobo so it would recognize this CPU. I have not even delved into the overclocking issues. Conclusion: this is not an entry level CPU. It is a lot more than that. It is capable of performing hyperthreading events and since I am an amateur DSLR photographer when we(my family) are on a road trip and do a lot of photo editing and recovery, it can do multitasking too without the hassle compared to the inferior Intel Core i3 2100s which deserves to go to a museum instead of an electronics store!!! 3 weeks into, I am satisfied.

Intel Core i7-3770 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770,4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Power but concerned about temperature,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2013","Very powerful processor at a great price! I bought this product in part because I was afraid it would soon become unavailable due to the emergence of the new Haswell processors. I bought it shortly it went up in price from $274.99 to about $285. Shortly after I bought it, it went back down in price again to $274.99 (probably to match Newegg's promotion during that time period). I will try to see if I can get a refund in the price difference.Anyways, it runs great, but I am concerned that it runs a little to hot for normal use/idle. It is running anywhere between 40 to 45 degree celsius in my setup, which is concerning. I've read online that the Ivy Bridge processors run quite a bit more hotter than the previous generation and the current (Haswell) chips, so I'm keeping that in mind, in addition to the fact that I live in Hawaii where the climate is quite hot and muggy. I'd love to hear input from anyone here on if they think these temperatures are normal (I can't seem to find any forums about this chip and its temperatures, but plenty of information on the K version).I'm using the stock cooler on this chip, which btw, the instructions in the box simply shows you picture diagrams of how to install the chip and cooler, but no real tips and tricks, recommendations, etc., or any info at all, about the thermal paste that is already on the cooler, best practices, etc.I have this chip on a Gigabyte H77N-Wi-Fi board, inside a BitFenix Prodigy case (which is small, but not that small for an mini ITX case, but surprisingly has plenty of room for cable management) with a Corsair CX 600M modular power supply. I'm running the stock bit-fenix 120mm case fan for the rear cooler plugged straight into the motherboard. I replaced the front fan with a molex powered 120mm case fan by Thermaltake. I even added a third fan (another thermaltake) at the top right over the motherboard. However, after noticing it started running even hotter! (46 to 51 degree celsius), I did more research and now I've learned there are even more important things to consider such as fan direction, air pressure balance, etc. (I'm still quite new at building custom computers). Any input anyone has for me would go a long way and would be appreciated!Hopefully, I can start doing more testing on this rig to see if it is defective or not. I could probably live with the high mid 40 degrees celsius idle temps, even if this represents a defect, if my system stays under around 85 or 80 degrees Celsius at full load (running a game with a dedicated graphics card, etc.)Thanks!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-3770 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770,"5.0 out of 5 starsBlown away by the speed, incredible multitasking","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2012","I opted for this CPU since I use lots of virtual machines for my day-to-day programming tasks, so having hyper-threaded virtual cores is somewhat worthwhile. Since this is the non-K version I can't overclock but I do get extra features like VT-x that most users probably won't need, but help with virtualization.With 16GB of RAM, I can easily run multiple guest operating systems on top of Windows 8 and the whole system still just flies. Even with folding@home running simultaneously using all 8 cores, I still have great multitasking performance. The guest operating systems feel as though they were installed to the bare metal computer.I've read lots of complaints about the stock cooler but I think most of those are unfounded. At idle, the fan is barely audible. My idle temperatures are around 35-45*C. The fan does spin up at higher loads, but it's still not noisy. Running folding@home it gets up to about 80*C, which while hot is well within Intel's thermal specification. Plenty of GPUs routinely have higher load temperatures than this. Using the IntelBurnTest, I get up to about 90-95*C which while very toasty is still below the maximum allowable temperature, and still stable. In practice, few or no applications will generate as much heat as this test. So unless you're overclocking, which is disabled on this particular chip anyway, you're probably fine with the stock cooler.Overall, highly recommended. I can't believe how much faster this machine feels than my old C2D E8400 machine with 4GB of RAM, which was already quick to begin with.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Previously I purchased one of the ""K"" series of these processors and was tweaking it by overclocking the processor. It was really, really fast but I didn't have any self control and kept trying to get more and more ghz from the ""K"" series processor until I tweaked it a bit too much and damaged the chip. This is why and how I decided to stick with this processor model instead. So if you really don't have any self control like me, better off getting this chip and save yourself a lot of heartache. The chip is fast, reliable and run very cool with the stock heatsink and fan unit it comes with. All this was running Win8 which I regret purchasing and should have stayed with Win7.

Very easy to install on the motherboard.  It's fast enough without overclocking.  If you want to overclock get the 3770K.  Still, the motherboard and the chip communicate to allow some tweaking but playing around with the settings is really unnecessary.  Combined with the OS on a solid state drive, this chip and a reliable MB make for the fastest computer I have ever owned, and I mean noticeably fast.  The OS boots up in seconds.  The aps and programs load almost instantly (unless the software slows load times purposefully to display startup and info screens).With this chip, a mid level graphics card and a good MB you can build a creditable gaming computer for well under $1000.00, that is pretty much future-proof; at least for the next ten years or so.

There's little reason to buy this over the K model.  Very few virtual PC software out there can take advantage of the extra capabilities the non-K version has.  And the ones that can usually don't see much performance improvement.  The few that do are specialty software products for network administrators.  Unless you're one of them and you know for sure the virtual OS software you'll be using takes advantage of it and sees a performance boost, get the K.  Otherwise you'll just be kicking yourself for not paying ten bucks more to have overclocking ability.  Sure, the Ivy Bridge CPUs do not overclock like the prior generation, but the slight boost that is possible even on air will do far more than you're likely to get out of the non-K's bonus features... let alone spending ten bucks on some other part of the computer.

Not as cheap a proposition as it once was, but this way I have complete control as to what the computer has inside, plus it will fit my needs like a glove. Not to mention, I bought all my parts with quality and durability in mind.I could have gone with a Core i5, but given that Haswell just came out, this little processor has gone down in price. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make it an attractive choice. So, I went for it. My new computer is only two days old. It is whisper quiet, and thanks to this processor and a decent video card, plenty fast as well. Thought for a while about getting the 3770K for a while, but ultimately decided it was not worth the price or the risk to eke out a bit more performance SAFELY (I am clearly not obsessed with overclocking). So, all in all, very satisfied with my purchase. I hope this Core i7 provides me with years of trouble free operation and fun.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i7-3770 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent all-purpose CPU,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2012","I believe this is an excellent CPU. It runs with no problem. I have a couple of additional comments to make, especially concerning some comments in other reviews. By the way, I used this to replace an i7-920 (which also required a new motherboard because it uses a different socket).1. Although this CPU is supposedly not able to be overclocked (except for turbo mode), I find that is easily overclocked. My Asus P8Z11-V Deluxe motherboard (and its utilities) will automatically overclock it to about 4.22 G. It runs there 24 hours a day with no problems or instability. Of course, it won't overclock as much as the i7-1770K.2. Concerning using the Intel CPU cooler that came with it: I used that at the beginning because I needed to get a different backplate for my CoolerMaster V8 CPU cooler. It did work, but was hot. With the V8 installed it runs more than 15 C cooler (at full load,(running folding at home with SMP (using 6 or 8 cores) and 2 GPUs) than with the original Intel cooler. So, if you overclock it and run it hard, I would recommend getting an after-market CPU cooler even though it will run somewhat OK with the original Intel cooler.I highly recommend this processor.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I previously owned the 2600K, but I never overclocked and didn't see a need to go with another K processor if I wasn't going to be overclocking the chip.  There is a lot of tweaking and testing involved in overclocking that I wasn't willing to research and spend hours on, and I'm pretty pleased with the speed as is.This chip does run a bit hotter than Sandy Bridge processors under load, and I noticed my fans run a bit higher, but you do gain access to PCI-E 3.0 and a some other features not available under Sandy Bridge.In my opinion, you don't really need to upgrade to Ivy Bridge unless you really want early access to PCI-E 3.0 or some other features.

Games that are CPU heavy though run smooth as I could ever want.

I upgraded a Q6600 and Gigabyte 965P mb to this processor and a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H rev 1.1 Z77 motherboard with 32gb of ram. Again, if you need virtualization support, both the MB and processor need to support it. I had to dig into the PDF manual of the D3H board to make sure it was supported before purchasing. Overall, it is much faster than my Q6600 was. Lightroom renders 36mp D800 previews about 2x as fast. VM's are also now blazingly fast.As a side note, I was amazed I could pick up 32gb of ram for $105...

My old CPU was showing its age and I needed an upgrade to help with my projects (I use Blender, AutoCAD, ESRI ArcGIS PRO, and Adobe Suites) along with it being my gaming PC. I have a Z370 board and had a few options. Either get an 1151 socket CPU, which the best you can get is the 9900k or get a 10th gen chip, but also buy a new motherboard AND windows 10 again (and if I go that route I might as well look at AMD).The 9900K is essentially the same as the new i7-10700k, which is much cheaper, but once you count for what else you have to replace it adds up. Lowering the price of the 9900k to be closer in price to the 10700k solidified my decision. I can keep my motherboard and not have to get a new license of windows. Just update the BIOS and switch out the chip.So far it has stepped up to the task and can handle anything I throw at it.

I side graded to this CPU from the Threadripper 1950x and instantly saw a HUGE performance increase in both games and the Adobe Suite. Even though it has half the cores/threads (of the threadripper), the way Intel engineers their chips, there is very low latency which is very important for gaming.I run this CPU in an Asus Maximus Hero XI mobo, works very well together.Keep in mind, if you plan to use this CPU, you’re going to need a very good cooler.  I recommend an AIO (all-in-one), I have the Corsair H100i V2.  Works well, I can overclock to 5ghz with no throttling.  If you’re going to use a fan block, you most likely won’t be able to hit 5ghz, go with an AIO if you can afford it.In terms of performance, I get over 150 FPS in most AAA games (on high settings) while using the 9900k with a 1080ti and 32gb of DDR4 3000mhz RAM.If you can afford it, I would go with the i9 9900k if you’re looking for a solid workstation/gaming pc hybrid.

I upgraded from a non-OC'd i7-4770K to a stable 4.9GHz OC'd i9-9900K and it is wicked fast. I have an OC'd GTX 1070 that I thought was pretty fast, but am now finding it to be my performance bottleneck (Mind you, I came from an i7-4770K, so I wasn't spoiled yet). I'm running a Noctua NH-D15 with their two included NF-A15 fans to keep the CPU cool. For about $70-80, I was able to squeeze out a significant amount of power because of Noctua's incredible product line, without the leakage risk of running water cooling. Overall very pleased and would recommend to anyone in the market with a mid-high budget.Edit: Got my hands on a 4 pin EPS connector for the additional 4 pin on my mobo's CPU power connection and was able to manage 5.0GHz stable at 1.315V.

The VRM set on the Gigabyte boards are second to none and that is the MOST important feature when powering a processor like this. The MB also features a second cpu power connector to make sure you get ample current to the CPU. It is a great matchup. Stays at 61-63 degrees under Cinebench R20 for 20 minutes scoring 5300.

Easily hit 5 Ghz on all cores and temps never hit above 80c when stress testing. Idle speeds are between 27-30c and in games such as Battlefield V they never go over 52c. You just need sufficient cooling. I am running an x72 360mm radiator and Noctura fans. Yes this CPU is pricey and that is the reason for the 4 stars. Everyone knows that this is a hot chip. Lots of reviews are complaining about temps and they have it on air or insufficient coolers.

A dodecahedron [sp] box with a black bag and a BIG plastic dodecahedron inside. The actual CPU could have been packaged in an ordinary envelope. For heaven's sake it's a chip.But worse, Intel doesn't even ship a basic heatsink and fan with it. They spent the money on the packaging!  I had to buy a cheap $25 fan to set things up.I've had a thirty year career in Si Valley so maybe I'm just a bit jaded with this techo-hype packaging.

Ho assemblato il PC con questo processore da più di un mese ormai e non ho mai avuto problemi, il dissipatore stock (grazie anche al case) fa un ottimo lavoro per un utilizzo normale ed anche sotto sforzo. La grafica inclusa è più che sufficiente per un utilizzo quotidiano ed un gaming leggero con una grafica, ovviamente, non full hd e con quale micro lag ogni tanto su giochi pesanti. Un paio di giorni fa ho giocato a più di un'ora a forza motorsport 6 (tra i requisiti minimi ha la presenza di una scheda video dedicata di 2GB, assente nel mio computer) e controllando le temperature non superavo i 28°. Ovviamente durante l'uso di giochi del genere, il PC subisce un leggero rallentamento. Lo uso inoltre per QGis, un programma che richiede comunque una buona risposta da parte del computer e quando mi trovo a compilare algoritmi, il processore li elabora in pochissimo tempo. Esistono processori sicuramente più potenti, ma comprando questo processore consci del suo valore economico e prestazionale, non si può non dargli 5 stelle, proprio perché soddisfa appieno ciò che promette.Consiglierei questo processore a tutti coloro che vogliono un PC in grado di poter fare tutto senza limitazioni ma anche senza pretese eccezionali (altrimenti non esisterebbero processori più potenti).",5.0 out of 5 stars

This CPU is a real powerhouse both in speed and in processing capability. As this CPU runs pretty hot when fully loaded, anyone who uses this CPU to it's full capability will simply need to get another cooling solution beyond what is supplied in the Intel box, or you will experience thermal throttling due to the high temperatures generated. While this CPU can be easily overclocked by a Z97 Motherboard, it really does not have a lot of headroom for extreme overclocking. The current speed of 4.0 to 4.4 GHz is very fast as is. A really significant overclock to 4.8 GHz or better will require a serious investment in custom water cooling, or you have a very rare CPU. As for me, the CPU is fantastic at 4.4 GHz, and not sure I have a need to get any more speed out of it. I am using an old Enzotech Extreme CPU air cooler, testing with AIDA 64 Extreme to stress the CPU, and I am getting about 68"" C average temperature out of the CPU at full load, at 1.18 Volts Core. Ummmm.....maybe I will tweak it up a bit. Happy Computing...!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Idles extremely cool. Strangely cool in fact, but in a good way.Cons: Not quite the OC'er Intel wanted us to think it was. But has 4.0 stock & 4.4GHz boost, so that's ok. Runs warm when OC'ed.I have to say that overall I am extremely pleased with my i7 4790k purchase and it's performance. It is so incredibly fast, and is actually just a hair shy of a $500 i7 3930k in most tasks which says a lot. That really is a big deal for a $300 proc.The 4790k idles strangely cool, in the low 20's (C) with my Corsair H80i, and is about 8-10C cooler than an i7 4770k at idle all things being equal. And it stays around 45-48C under work load such as gaming, etc. It is a real beast of a processor.However, overclocking is not as great as we thought it would be. I think Intel's early claims of a new improved TIM and voltage regulation was an exaggeration, and it still doesn't come close to Sandy Bridge's fluxless solder IHS. It may be better than the Haswell version 1.0, I'll give you that - but it's still not ""that great.""

I upgraded from an AMD FX-8350 in the summer of 2015. The frame jump was so high that I didn't even realize that I hadn't enable the SLI for the second GTX 970 that I bought along with it. When it sits almost idle, doing small things, it floats around 4.0-4.1GHz. BUT, when you put it under stress(like playing any game or benchmarking it), it jumps up to a stable 4.3GHz. I even saw it sit at 4.4GHz on one benchmark. And the included cooler did a good job of keeping the temp stable when I ran three benchmarks in a row on the 3DMark software too. The stock cooler is actually extremely quiet, also. I love this processor and recommend that you just eat the upfront cost. For the performance it gives, it's entirely worth the money. Combine this with a GTX 970 and you can just about max out Crysis 3 and Fallout 4 at 1080p. Just about. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I don't even plan on upgrading to the 6th gen 6700K whatsoever. I'll just put in another GPU. The performance difference is extremely minimal, and with the cost of the LGA1151 and DDR4 stuff, this is the better value.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The Intel heat sink and fan are inadequate with core temperatures hitting 100 deg C immediately under full load.  Wattage was successfully reduced by lowering CPU Vcore to 1.150 Volts and  VRIN to 1.710 Volts.  The BIOS of my Gigabyte Z97X-UD3H-BK motherboard allowed setting these voltages lower which was the first step taken to reduce CPU Core temperatures.Chosen to replace the i7-4790K stock heat sink is a Cooler Master Geminll S524 Version 2 CPU Air Cooler with 120 mm Silencio FP fan (RR-G5V2-20PK-R1).  With it, typical core temperatures dropped to 70 – 72 degrees centigrade with maximum variation 67 – 74 deg C under continuous full Turbo Boost load.The software application generating the load is the BOINC client running on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LS.

Combined with a fast SSD and enough RAM, this CPU just cuts through tasks like they are half as intense as they really are. The part about a fast ssd and enough ram is important though, because this CPU likely is never the limiting factor in any process or game, it destroys its part of most tasks. Paired with a 970 it crushes every game I play at 1080p, probably would go for a 980 or 980ti to maintain 60+ framerates at 1440p or above.This is pretty much the pinnacle of performance as far as 4 core processors go, for now, doesn't seem like Skylake 6000 series processors are too much faster.I could have easily gone for an i5-4690K instead, but my laptop had an i7 and gosh darn it, my badass PC would have hyperthreading as well. Besides, as time goes on, more and more applications will take advantage of the performance boost that hyperthreading offers, and since I intend to use this CPU for probably at the very least 3 years (5 more likely), having that extra capability is worth it to me.So fast!

Without knowing what the previous owner did to the cpu I'd rather pay $50 more for the assurance that I have a new product with Amazon's excellent customer service behind it. I overclocked only a little but have more satisfactory temperatures at stock configuration of 4ghz base, 4.4ghz turbo which is plenty of power. If you are building an all new system go for the i7-7700k as it will be supported on newer motherboards with newer options like USB-C etc. If you already have a lga1150 motherboard and want to move up from an i3 or I5 this will be cheaper than adopting a whole new motherboard platform and you won't be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

If you are surfing the web or playing games with your system then you probably do not need this processor and the i5-4690K is a much better economical option.Why would I buy a K rated processor over a standard version if I do not plan to overclock it? Simply because they are better processors. When processors are tested, they must pass a myriad of tests before they are marked and shipped.

With no over clock this was getting a little warmer than I would of liked to see.

Either cause the system was old or the motherboard/gpu needed logic board repair that i don't have enough experience in to offer as a repair service. So I used a known good motherboard from an old computer and a cpu out of a Dell system with a compatible cpu and built the system around my old gpu that I had managed to revive.He wanted to upgrade it and either stream or record his games. I never had issues with the gpu he has so I figured the cpu/ram could use an upgrade as the one I gave him couldn't overclock. My system has a xeon x5675 so I knew that the cpu difference would give my system an unfair advantage. That and the larger cpu cache size. So I looked around found a cheap i7 3770k on Amazon and got him some more ram as well as a scythe Mugan 5 cpu cooler so we could do some minor overclocking.However after installing the new cpu and cooler. The system would not post.Checked firmware. No further bios update available.Reset bios to factory settings, maybe there was something I missed or didn't pay attention to. Still didn't help.Swapped cpu cooler back to stock intell. NothingTook out all ram leaving one after reinstalling the scythe cooler. System boots up and posts. Clears windows no problem.It continued to post regardless of which slot I used for the single stick of ram. And regardless of which stick of ram I used.Now im thinking maybe its something stupid like a screw stuck behind the mobo in the case. So I continued all further testing out of the case.No change. System will not boot with more than one stick of ram regardless of which slot that one stick is in.I've been doing this a while so I went back to the old i5 to verify that the mobo was still good. And the system goes back to normal with the i5 installed. No ram issues even with max memory supported installed in dual channel on 4 slots.I figure I overlooked something with motherboard compatibility so I ordered a different motherboard I have experience with the i7 3770k working on as it was a friends computer. Lmao come tho think of it its an identical build with the same gpu.After swapping out the motherboard the system still persisted to have the issue again, only with the i7 and not the i5. I look at the i7 pin pads. And notice the 5 that are responsible for the memory controller circuit seem worn through like someone messed with the screw on the motherboard and over tightened the lga socket. But we have never messed with either and neither mobo has a stiff lever beyond what is normal for this socket.I checked the i5 and the pad damage is not there.I have tried 3 times since this purchase to get a refund or a replacement to no avail.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And the I7 3770K is great for this. Whilst only having 4 physical cores, it can be hyper-threaded into 8 cores. I had previously read that this wasnt as good as an 8 physical cored processor -as your probably have guessed, but I went ahead with my purchase.Instillation was relatively simple, but I was still neverous at placing the brackets back over - I didint want to damage a pin on a £250 CPU. But everything installed great! Please note, this does require 2x 6 pin power for the PSU.After instillation I done what any other self confessed geek would do; I jumped straight into my benchmark software. Firstly, I tried the Intel Burn Test -which isn't actually made by intel. This little piece of software seen all 8 threads jump up to 100% load and reached around 68 Degrees Celsius. On a after market Corsair H60 Cooler.I then used 3D Mark 11 and Vantage, unfortunately I do not have these results to share but the end result wasn't stunning but it was highly respectable.But I guess it more of a work load based thing. So I opened up my Sony Vegas Pro 12 (64 Bit) and started doing some video editing. The results were brillant! I edit in 1920x1080p full HD and the CPU was utilizing all threads for the work @ around 50-60%. I then rendered the video and the cores reached the expect 60-80% work load and raised to 50 Degrees Celsius. My 10 minute video was done in 7 minutes! I was astonished! I was previously using an AM3 AMD Phenom x4 955 BE and that took up to and hour for a similar piece!But for the gamers out there, I highly recommend this! It will be coming down in price and games will start to use those all importent threads within the next couple of years. Especially since the next gen consoles have up to 8 cores! You're really wanting a system that will run games brillantly. As I said, video editing wise this is dandy but in-games it's actually great! I play things like Shogun 2 and the recent Total War installments and the thing runs them great - I dont have any stats sorry,but It copes with any issues in 4v4 land battles at 50-60 FPS. Please note, I use a dedicated video card (GTX 570 2.5 GB).Overall,I love this CPU! It idles at around 30 Degrees for me and is clocked perfectly-I haven't tried O.C yet.

Die neuen Haswell kommen ja bald. Aber eigentlich sind die CPUs schnell genug, um Spiele zu zocken.Paar Eckdaten:Intel Core i7-3770k (Dritte Generation)Sockel 1155Geschwindigkeit: 3,5 GHz / 3,9 TurboBoostKerne: 4Vorsicht ist angebracht, bei der Wahl des Prozessors. Mehr GHz oder Mehr Kerne bedeuten nicht unbedingt, dass die Programme schneller laufen. Ein Programm profitiert nur dann von mehr kernen, wenn es dafür optimiert worden ist, ist er es nicht, dann gibt es nur dann einen Vorteil, wenn man viele Prozesse gleichzeitig laufen will. Dies ist bei Spielen in der Regel nicht so. Wenn man auf die Systemvorraussetzungen von Spielen guckt sieht man i.d.R. DualCore 2,4-3,2 GHz. Spiele profitieren also nicht unbedingt von den 4 Kernen, wenn man nicht unbedingt viele Hintergrundprozesse hat. Bei den Systemvorraussetzungen wird der Resourcenverbrauch des Betriebssystems schon mit eingerechnet. Wahrscheinlich auch eines Virenscanners.Mal ein Rechenbeispiel:Ich schreibe ein Programm optimiert für Single Core. Dieses Programm berechnet mathematische Formeln. Auf einem Vierkern CPU a 2,4 GHz wird dieses Programm langsamer laufen als auf einem DualCore 3 GHz (OS und Hintergrundprozesse verwenden den 2ten Kern). Ein Programm was aber die Kerne ausnutzen kann wird auf den Vierkerner besser laufen. Man kann Single-Core Prozesse nicht Multicore machen.Dieser CPU wird lange noch aktuell bleiben, denn für Spiele ist die GPU (also Grafikkarte wesentlich wichtiger sein). Deshalb finde ich Gaming Laptops auch nicht berauschend, da man dort i.d.R. die Grafikkarte nicht wechseln kann und somit das komplette Gerät wechselt, obwohl nur die Grafikkarte neu benötigt würde.Mit freundlichen Grüßen",4.0 out of 5 stars

Adios a los 5GHz!En mi caso es el primer i7 que tengo, venia de un AMD athlon x2.El rendimiento es increible en cualquier tarea!Lo uso a 4.4GHz con 1.17V, no se calienta apenas en reposo,ronda los 35-40ºC, aunque en plena carga supera los 80ºC.Da igual que compreis el disipador mas grande de todos: esta generacion de micro no tiene soldado el chip al disipador integrado (la ""chapa"" de metal que lo cubre, el IHS), sino que le han puesto una pasta termica barata.Esto provoca que el calor generado no se pueda evacuar tan facilmente como el la segunda generacion (i7 2700k).Asi que lo que ocurre es que el disipador que le pongais, realmente no pasara de 60ºC, ni tampoco la ""chapa"" del micro, pero si el chip del procesador.Esto se cree que es una tactica de Intel para limitar el overcloking extremo que se podia hacer en estos micros, es muy dificil conseguir 5GHz con esta generacion, mientras que con la segunda era muy comun alcanzarlo e incluso superar esa barrera.La cuarta generacion, el 4770K, tiene el mismo sistema, y ademas el chip es mas pequeño, por lo que el area de contacto con el disipador integrado es menor, y sumandole la mala conductividad de la pasta termica pues limita bastante el overcloking que se puede conseguir.En general, es una buena compra, y espero que me dure al menos 5 años tirando con todo lo que le echen.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's currently in my new Bitfenix Prodigy M-ITX build and it functions like a dream. I use my system for gaming and video editing as I am a proud member of the YouTube community. I can be rendering a video in Sony Movie Studio Platinum 11 Suite, playing Minecraft and recording it at the same time in 1080p without frame drops. Videos also render really quick, being almost twice as fast as real time, I can render a video that is 50 minutes long and it will render within 30 minutes. What more could you ask for?I am thinking of doing a 4GHz overclock soon as I have used the Zalman CNPS9900 Max CPU cooler in my build instead of the stock one. Currently it is operating at stock clocks and after running Prime 95 for 30 minutes it only reached a maximum of 62 Celsius. Most of the time though it stays around 55 Celsius while rendering a video. Prime 95 is good for testing the temperatures although these results are quite synthetic since the CPU will never reach 100% usage unless your running a program like Folding At Home.All in all, I'm glad I went for the i7 over the i5. That's up to you to decide though depending on what sort of PC you would want. If you're only gaming on the system, get the i5. The i7's Hyper-threading on the i7 makes hardily any difference, and you're saving about £80. Meanwhile, if you're recording, rendering and heavily multi-tasking go for the i7. It was the best ever decision I've made.This CPU will not disappoint you in any way.Also, check out my YouTube channel if you like: Warrenaterz",1.0 out of 5 stars

This is an unlocked chip. Mine OCs to 5Ghz no problem, but gets to, and stays at 100C with all the sensor tests I could find to run on it. Running anything even slightly CPU dependent will ramp those temps up, although not for long, they still get there. I've used Prime 95 both 26.6 and the latest version and they both bring the temps to 100C while load is creeping up to 10% in Real Temp.As for coolers so far I've used an EVO 212 and the Master Air Maker 8, which I returned because of the high temps my 7700k was achieving. While 5Ghz is a hefty OC and only 25% of chips are supposed to be stable at this OC, I am seeing numerous Youtube.com videos being produced where enthusiasts buy a $30 3-D printed Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) removal tool, remove the Thermal Interface Material (TIM) and replace it with something like the  $25 Cool Labs liquid metal applied in place of the stock TIM and replace the IHS. Doing this they are able to achieve 20C lower temps! That would put my CPU in safe range! Is that so much to ask for a $350 CPU? I guess it is 10 years later, when there are no competitors after paying Micheal Dell $1 Billion a year to exclusively use Intel CPUs.Edit: Temps with the DH-15 with 2 fans without noise reduction resistors. Gets the temps below 71c for everyday applications that previously brought it to 91c with the EVO 212 and the Air Maker 8.

At first I was unable to get past 4.8Ghz, but after I adjusted the vcore calibration curve to ""turbo"" on my Gigabyte Z270X Gaming K5 I was able to achieve it no problem. (this prevents the core voltage from dropping under high load and causing a blue screen)I did delid the processor to improve the temperatures (drastically).  Delidding is a process of removing the metal cap on the CPU and replacing the thermal paste under it.  This can be achieved using a Rockit Cool 88 and a youtube video, sounds terrifying, but trust me it isn't - if you can build a PC, you can delid a processor.  I achieved a 20C drop in temperatures after deliding, this is the only reason I am giving this CPU a 4/5 - the thermal past that intel uses on this processor is JUNK.All in all a beast of a processor, you'll be very happy you purchased it.Attached: Temperatures under 100% load.

On these chips Intel is using some pretty not that good thermal compound between the die and integrated heat spreader, meaning this thing gets hot! It'll also randomly Spike in temps at times (I've seen so far on mine a max spike of 20 degrees C!) Intel's response to this is that you shouldn't overclock even though you are paying the premium for it. From what I've seen the solution to these heat issues is delidding (which means voiding the hell out of your warranty) and replacing that poor thermal paste with some form of liquid metal (grizzly conductonaut is  one that seems to be the best). I haven't gotten a chance to overclock yet, (I need to get a new cooler). I'm currently running mine with Noctua l9x65, which isn't even recommended by noctua for this chip without good airflow and disabling something In bios, and I'm reaching temps between 82-87 C during prime 95 stress testing for 30 ish minutes. During gameplay in fallout4 with a gtx 1060 6gb with some heavy modding I reach about 71 max and fps stays at my 61 fps max cap  in most situations, EVEN in downtown area gunfights.TLDR: This is an alright chip at stock, but intel's premium price and lack of premium support (out right telling everyone not to overclock and poor IHS thermal compound  )  for an unlocked chip makes it hard to recommend. If you don't need the upgrade right now, Id say wait to see if intel's next chip series is more overclocking friendly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I built my pc before I had my graphics card, mainly to install all my games and software that I use. I used to play League of Legends and CS:GO alot on my old pc, and because it has a older dual core processor and no graphics card, I would get 48 frames on average in League of Legends and about 18 frames on average in CS:GO.  This processor, on the same low settings, will get a solid 180 fps in League of Legends and between 80-120 fps in CS:GO. And that's only at the stock clock, I didn't really stretch my overclock on this card, I only have it overclocked to 5ghz, but I with that I've noticed faster load times in various programs and some fps increase on some games. This processor should be a cheaper option to good performance, compared to current pricing of coffee lake.

Think of it as Skylake's Devils Canyon.  This processor is an absolute beast when it comes to overclocking.  I expect to start seeing Sandy Bridge era overclocking commonplace again (I mean people hitting 5GHz regularly).  This was all but unattainable with Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Skylake.  Only the rare special binned chips could hit 5GHz and even then most were barely stable.  This i7 7700k will be a 5GHz monster, and handles it with ease.  Yes, there is a caveat, it seems to run just a tad warmer temp wise than ideal, but really nothing to be concerned about - because if you are buying this you should be investing in a quality AIO cooler anyway, or doing a custom loop that will tame that heat.

I LOVE how powerful it is, but I do not understand why intel purposefully manufactured these chips with poor material. The thermal interface material houses so much heat. Chips that are delidded literally run minimum 20C cooler, some even cooler. And that's not an exaggeration.With AMD Ryzen 1700X being $50 more, about $390 compared to 7700k at $340, there is literally no reason to purchase a 7700k. If intel does not change their manufacturing process and provide a superior product that doesn't need to be delidded to actually run properly at a normal temperature, I will never buy intel again.At 4.6 ghz (0.1 ghz above stock 4.5 ghz) at the lowest vcore I could manage to run prime95, real bench, and cinebench stable for over 48 hours, my temperatures spiked to 88-91C and on average while gaming and streaming I run at about 80C. The cpu runs ridiculously hot while barely pushing an overclock on a top end cpu air cooler with good case ventilation. 4.5 ghz runs the chip at 70-75C. This is unacceptable for a top end product and benchmarks place AMD Ryzen far above the 7700k for both practical and theoretical uses. I didn't watercool, but if the product was made better, I shouldn't have to.

I've built many a PC in my career and I'm sure the cooler was mounted properly and my BIOS firmware was up to date.

Many people are ""de-lidding"" their 7700K's to replace the TIM (thermal interface material) with higher quality stuff and dropping 20*C under load.  Obviously, that would void the warranty and not a step that I'm willing to take, so this one was returned and I got a 6700K instead.  Using the same cooler, it remains in the high 60's or so (ambient at about 22*C) under load, even when I overclock it to the same speed as the 7700K (4.5 GHz).  The fact that the core temp would fluctuate rapidly and to such a great degree also caused the CPU & case fans to go nuts under normal working conditions - speeding up and slowing down quickly was very annoying.

Between the higher clock speed, IPC improvements from Haswell -> Broadwell -> Sky/Kaby Lake, and Hyperthreading it's a LOT faster in multi-threaded applications, and a bit faster in games when paired with a GTX 1080.If you've got the cash to spend and are upgrading from a 4.5Ghz i5 Haswell or slower it's a decent upgrade. If you already have a recent i7 or 6000 series chip hitting that magic 5.0Ghz is awesome, but probably won't provide much of a real world speed increase.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Been in service in my main workstation ever since then, and it shows no signs of stopping. I've had it paired with a Noctua NH-D14 cooler since Day 1 (the Intel stock cooler literally hasn't come out of the box in the nearly 7 years I've had it) and it's been a workhorse. It still holds its ground quite well, only obsoleted by the fact that nothing newer than an LGA1150-socket motherboard supports it.Powerful cooling is a *MUST* with Haswell, as these CPUs run HOT, especially under heavy AVX/AVX2 loading, as video rendering tends to do, hence the Noctua NH-D14. Regardless of the heatsink that you install on it, you need to ensure that the heatsink gets good, clean air.Overclocking is a bit of a delicate ballet with these CPUs, as well. YMMV, but I had to lock my ring voltage to 1.2 or 1.3V, ring frequency to 4000MHz, memory voltage to 1.35V, and then I set the FSB to 100MHz with a 46x multiplier.

This chip is in 7 clients' builds yet today, because every time they ask about upgrading I bring them over and let them sit down in front of the newest and prettiest, be it the venerable 6850K, 5930K, 5820K, 6700K, 6800K, 7700K and now the 8700K (I'm not a fan of the i9's or X's).  Nothing I have is noticeably better all around than this CPU, period.  You can take the specs and wipe with them for all the difference you'll actually see in real life applications.  It's no fun to say that because I WANT to see a difference.  I can clock this thing to 4.7 on water with such a small adjustment in voltage it's crazy, and rise only 5-7 degrees C with a custom loop to idle at 38-40 degrees and run hot right around 50 (a little of it is due to my loops and 20+ years of building), but no other CPU I've used  reacts like that.  I own games.  I've never finished 95%  of them because to this day almost nothing taxes the CPU.  So I test with video editing.  4 cores and 8 threads is enough for any normal human, if you're a pro then you'll want something for an X99 or 2011/2066 board.The only cons are that this is going up in price and Z97 boards are harder to find new.  When I read that the 6700K, 7700K and 8700K are upgrades I just grin.  And why the 6 and 7 series were produced at all is nothing but marketing and little tweaks that aren't noticeable.  I have a Threadripper as well as all the above and more, and when you want to be stunned then see what all those cores are good at and compare THAT to Intel's consumer chips.  AMD's version of the Xeon is NOT great all around but the Intel folks aren't any smarter than the AMD developers, they only have deeper pockets to draw from and a longer history of doing the same thing the same way.  That's why the 4790K stands out...but until the 8700K I think Intel was just punching the clock.  It's a superb CPU that's NOT going down in price AT ALL because it's still so viable that the software has yet to catch up.  If it's used with the right board, with the right RAM and BIOS set the right way I'd still put it up against the 8700K built by 95% of the market that's buying them and getting their comparisons on their cell phones and shouting specs from the rooftops :-)  Next time just ask them how many Ghz to fill a gallon halfway?!!

There are also articles Benchmarking the i7 4790K with all fans set to low and the processor runs at a constant 100°C with only none, or negligible loss. meaning, to burn this processor you would have to do something wrong, or it has to be defective in the first place.

OK, it works for now... though I can't get used to the high temperatures. I am using a H80i Corsair ... still seeing 80's on stress tests. Gaming, with good GPU, you won't see above 70's with stock cooler, with a 560 Ti I am seeing 77°C running Mass Effect 3, FireFall (72), Tom Clacy's Splinter Cell Black Ops(75°C)... it really depends on how efficiently they made their engines and how dependent they are on the processor, most FPS games are focused on using the monkey-house GPU rather than the brain-trust CPU.The only drawback is the heat.

Using the stock frequency and with the ""most heat"" setting of Prime95 stress tester my liquid cooling system is not able to keep up and it overheats.  Using the ""balanced"" setting of Prime95 it does fine.  This may not bode very well for overclocking, I may need to upgrade my cooling system.  I'm using a Corsair H60 120mm liquid cooler with Tuniq TX-4 ultra high performance thermal compound.  My previous CPU, an i5 4670K, did not come near overheating under the same conditions.  Since this i7 uses hyper threading on 4 cores for a total of 8 threads, along with the higher frequency, increases it's workload greatly.  I'm also not sure how well Prime95 really simulates actual conditions.  Nothing else I've thrown at it in normal usage causes an overheat.  More testing ahead.  The Amazon ""Prime only special"" price on this was nice too.Update:I updated to a 240mm water cooler and this CPU is now running much cooler even with some mild overclocking but it still cannot handle Prime95's ""most heat"" setting.  It immediately overheats.  I think that test may not reflect real world conditions.  Nothing else, even with some overclocking, comes near to overheating the CPU.  I don't know if the Prime95 application was written with this type of processor in mind.  So I will continue to test with a bit more overclocking and see what happens.  I won't test any further with that 'most heat' setting of Prime95. Otherwise this CPU has been working great, no problems at all.  With this CPU and an SSD boot drive Windows 10 boots almost instantly.Update:It was suggested that I try an older version of Prime95 to test (see comments) and it does work as it should with the older 26.6 version.  It runs at 68-70 C using the same settings that caused it to overheat with the later version.  Some internet research verifies this to be an issue between at least some of the latest Intel CPUs and the later Prime95 versions.  I had suspected it to be an issue with Prime 95 and apparently it is.  So if you are going to use Prime95 to test this CPU, I at least, recommend you use the earlier version of Prime95 to avoid prematurely making toast out of your CPU.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I finally couldn't say no to upgrading my old rig (an almost 6 year old AMD Athlon X3 [yeah that's right, triple core!])After graduating college I finally have a job that can afford me to build something a little nicer than a budget rig. So I splurged on this beast of a cpu and paired it with an ASUS Hero VII Z97 motherboard.To be real with you, the last time I built a rig I had a techie friend with me who kind of babied me through it. I didn't even have half the amount of money sunk into that setup as I do this one... so doing it friendless was terrifying.By that I mean my friend wasn't there. I have friends. I swear.I purchased a Cooler Master Hyper Evo 212 to slap on top and make an ""Arctic Silver 5"" sandwich. Can I just say there is something supremely horrifying about hearing the creek of a $200 motherboard as I tighten the screws on a heat sink over a $300 processor?Luckily, I did not destroy the setup. Turns out they build this stuff to survive the clumsy hands of a novice such as myself.I planned on overclocking this chip (or else why get the k?) but it's so darn fast right now I just don't feel motivated too. I'm enjoying a stock 4ghz hyper threaded quad-core CPU at an idle of 34-35 degrees and a load of about 60-65. Ran Prime95 and the chip would barely blip above 68 degrees.I truly couldn't be happier with this chip. I'm sure I'll eventually get crazy and start overclocking it... but I just can't think of a practical reason to overclock a chip that is so dang fast on it's own.Look, this is an expensive chip. But you get what you pay for with Intel. AMD is great for a budget rig, but I couldn't be happier with this purchase.I might be eating ramen noodles for dinner for the next month (they don't pay elementary school teachers that much) but at least I'll eat ramen while enjoying my computer time that much more.(Btw... this is unrelated. But add a dash of sriracha sauce to your ramen noodles. I was super impressed with the extra dash of flavor.)",4.0 out of 5 stars

Coming from a non-biased view, it's amazing. I've owned both high-end AMD CPUs, older gen Intel i7s, and AMD GPUs, so I'm not stuck to one company over another, but the 4790 is the best processor I've had the pleasure of owning. The performance is just amazing. If you do a lot of video editing and want the speed for processor intense activities like rendering, CAD, etc., the power is there. For gaming and CPU intensive games, it has the speed so you're not being throttled and limited like you were with older generations i7s like my old Clarksfield i7-840QM. If a game you're playing is only utilizing a single core, the 1.87 GHz speed of that older i7 really kills you, but these new 4th generation i7s have all you need and then some, even if running off a single core. I have noticed some in the gaming community saying go with the i5-4670k as it's still good in performance, but cheaper and thus lets you spend more elsewhere. However I wouldn't recommend the i5, as spending a bit more up-front to future proof your computer so you save more down the road is always the better option, and the price difference is negligible. When I purchased this CPU on sale, the price difference between what I bought this for and what the lower-end 4670K costs, is less than I would of spent for a tank of gas.As a side note, as this is a K model and unlocked, it's made for overclocking. If you overclock, these overclock very well, but do tend to run a little hot over their previous iterations, so having a good aftermarket heat sink is a must (or watercooling if that's your thing). However, even if you don't overclock, having this model helps to future-proof your PC by allowing you to squeeze added performance out of the processor, and get you that much more use from your computer before you have to shove out more money for new parts. So I'd definitely recommend the K version even if you don't have immediate plans on overclocking.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Need Liquid Cooler!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2015","I reluctantly give this product 5 stars, not because there is anything wrong with the product itself, but instead because of the stock heatsink provided. It's horrible, to say the least.Upon booting my PC after installation the fan wound up, into what I can only imagine was the fastest RPM it could pull. During this wind up, it made the most horrible noise, as if a race car was driving through my house. Once it leveled out at roughly 37c, the fan lowered its RPM's, but it was still incredibly loud, I could hear it over the YouTube videos about replacement options for said fan.When I tried to run Rainbow Six: Siege, the CPU heated up to 105c, and averaged 100c. This was without any overclocking, 16gb RAM, and an R9 390x, plus 2 extra fans in my case.I realized that for any CPU usage, a air cooler just wouldn't do for this CPU. I immediately bought a Corsair Hydro H100i GTX. Upon installation/boot, I didn't hear a whisper of a noise. The CPU idles at around 27c, and running Rainbow Six: Siege/Assassin's Creed: Syndicate/GTA V/Fallout 4 (All on ultra settings) - the CPU never exceeded 60c, and idles around 55c for said games.So the product is incredible, it is what's on the box. The downside is, please do your research for a proper cooling solution that will fit your case. There is no way that the stock cooler will work in any condition at all, and it's literally pointless for them to include it.I debated on leaving 4 stars, because I feel that the product should be marketed in a way to let people know upfront that they will have to invest in a decent cooler (more expenses down the line) to get the product to function as intended.

One, The reviewers who had overheating issues had a bad cooling system; two, they're very bad at using the BIOS; three, I must have the most golden 4790K to hit the shelves.

I've never overclocked. It hits the thermal shutdown temp within seconds of any CPU stress test and powers off the PC. Went through 3 PSUs and 2 motherboards, reseated Noctua HS/F countless times. I also swapped memory four times, removed the video card, and did everything possible to try to diagnose and fix this.  I didn't even consider the CPU being bad a possibility, but I've now narrowed it down. There's a huge thread about this issue on the Intel support forums and Anandtech documented a manufacturing defect in their official review involving the adhesive pushing the heatspreader away from the die. This defect was present in Ivy Bridge as well and is due to Intel using adhesive instead of solder like on Sandy Bridge.This is the first computer that I didn't obsessively research every part for, guess that'll teach me.The system is quite stable and doesn't go above 70C except for stress tests or AVX workloads which explains why this issue isn't very well known.Intel support thread: https://communities.intel.com/thread/54032?start=0&tstart=0Anandtech review mentioning the defect: http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review-intel-core-i7-4790k-and-i5-4690kedit: I just tried a beta BIOS for my motherboard that was released a week ago and the problem is not as bad, but still extremely problematic. AVX stress test puts all cores at 96C+ within the first few seconds.  Still going ahead with the CPU RMA and hoping I get a better one this time. There are two elements to the problem:1. CPU runs hot due to heat spreader/die gap and crappy thermal compound in between heat spreader+die.2. Many motherboards are giving ""too much power"" but in reality Intel recommends turning down power levels to where the chip will sometimes not reach full speed during Turboboost, or for a reduced time.  Unacceptable.  This also makes overclocking all but impossible despite the product in question being a marked up K SKU.here's the guide from an Intel employee on the forums:https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-23517He even warns against using XMP memory profiles to avoid overheating the CPU(at stock clocks/voltage??).  What a joke.  I appreciate his effort but Intel as a company needs to take some ownership here.  Sadly they likely never will, thanks to zero competition from AMD in the high-end CPU market and the processor working well enough for many people.I have a friend who works IT for a bank and he has this exact same issue but his issue played out in a very different but I suspect a more common way:He never tested the machine to see if it was stable and immediately overclocked with the assumption that a 212+ should be good enough cooling.  It wasn't stable but he chalked this up to the overclock.  It still crashes every week or so and sometimes during games but he's doing nothing to fix it.  I actually put all his motherboard settings back to default and did an AVX stress test.  It triggered the test's overheat alarm at 85C and failed the test within seconds, almost as bad as mine.  He has still done nothing to fix it and the computer is unstable to this day, months later.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This is a pretty amazing processor; most likely overkill for a lot of users, but perfect for people who want the best.  For me, in day to day tasks, I can't really tell a huge difference between my old i5 and this. They're both rocket-fast paired with a SSD.  The difference shows, however, in a gaming environment. The only game I use is Flight Simulator X, which is a CPU-intensive title as compared to other games that rely more on GPU.  For Flight Sim, you get the fastest CPU you can afford if you want the best performance, and you can even skimp a bit on your video card. Although I set a fixed frame rate in Flight Sim, with it at unlimited I get in the 80s at ultra high (tweaked) settings, compared to the 60s with the i5.  Mind you this is with a less powerful video card - a GT740 SC 4GB DDR5 as opposed to a GTX650Ti.  The comparison isn't apples to apples, and would likely be a bit higher with the same card.  Closing words - if you are a gamer, and you want fast, get this. If you do other things that demand huge processing power, get this. If you're a home office user, you're overspending if you get this.

If you are incrementally upgrading your PC, this is the best deal going, period. Previously I was running an i5 2500k. In order to upgrade I had to purchase a new motherboard, owing to the 1150 vs 1151 cpu slot. But I was able to re-purpose my  (expensive) existing 16GB of RAM. Moving up to the next level of processor would have required replacing all of my DDR3 RAM with DDR4. And the MoBo's are more expensive. I figure it would have cost me an additional $400-$500 to realize maybe 10-15% faster performance. No brainer for me.I paired it with an ASUS MoBo, this one...ASUS ATX DDR3 2600 LGA 1150 Motherboards Z97-A/USB 3.1. This allowed me to easily leverage the overclocking potential of the chip. Using the auto OC function of the BIOS, I have been able to achieve Passmark scores in the 12000 range, basically the same as the $100 more expensive  i7-3930K (and don't forget the added costs).All in all I'm super happy with this CPU. Definitely spend the extra couple of bucks for this rather than the non-K version.

Nope, the poor thing was maxed out at 100% utilization and both my game and stream were dropping frames left and right even when using NVENC on my GPU to encode the stream video.So I bought this i7, overclocked it to 4.5GHz like my old CPU, and next time I streamed I had no trouble at all keeping 60FPS even during intense ship battles and large skeleton fights. Though the 4790k still only has 4 physical cores like the i5, the 8 virtual cores provided via hyperthreading made all the difference for juggling the intense workload incurred by streaming and keeping everything running smoothly.

This absolutely blows it away, as you'd expect.Converting blu-rays to x.265 using Handbrake with RF ~20 using the ""medium"" preset I get a little over 12 frames per second on average (no overclock). I tried the ""slow"" preset and was getting 5-6 fps, which is too slow to maintain my sanity. I never even bothered trying video conversion on my old i3 so I don't really have anything to compare it with.I'm using a Corsair Hydro H80i GT for cooling and it idles around 84F (~70F ambient). Peak temperature while encoding (CPU between 95 and 99% usage) seems to be 127F. Not using any special thermal grease.I tried the auto-overclock option in my motherboard's bios and that just forced the cores to their turbo-boost speed of 4.4 Ghz. Haven't played with any *real* overclocking yet.Can't wait to get a i7-6950X and see what that can do. :-)",5.0 out of 5 stars

Will work great for most average users with the stock heat sink, however, be forewarned it will get very hot. With the stock heat sink on Prime 95 version 26 it would easily get up to 95-99 C and throttle back. While gaming it would hover around high 70s C. Disabling HyperThreading and Turboboost would clock it back to 4.0 GHz instead of 4.4 GHz which helps temps if you don't have an after market cooler. Around 85 C on Prime 95 and high 60s C during gaming with these disabled.Installed a Noctua nh-u12s which drastically help keep better temps which I recommend doing. With this cooler installed I get around mid 70s C on Prime 95 and around mid 50s C during gaming with HT and Turboboost enabled.While the stock cooler will work fine in most instances even for gaming, I would recommend to purchase an aftermarket one if you plan on pushing the CPU for extended periods or any overclocking what so ever.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I didn't realize how big a difference it would make going from an AMD 8350 to this. Games that wouldn't run on the 8350 ran great on this. I thought there was something wrong with Crysis or Mass Effects port to PC. It was that the 8350 wasn't good enough. The memory and gpu being the same or very close the only reason for the huge difference in playability was this chipset. I should have known because I had Crysis running on an older I7 960 with an old 1 gig gpu( really old 5 years old). If you want to game and want something that will probably work well for the next few years this is a good choice. Save your pennies, don't buy AMD, the difference between this and the FX8350 is night and day. I leave OC on auto and use the stock fan, it gets warm buy survives for now, eventually Ill get a 90mm cooler from Noctua.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I was going to make sure I can run virtualization (Windows 7 and Oracle VirtualBox) and I can with this one.  The BIOS has some additional features that are enabled due the ""K"" designation of the CPU.  I could not be happier with my choice.  The fan that comes with the CPU is probably the noisiest fan inside of my case, but since it is inside of the case, I guess it is reasonable.  If I need to overclock, I will buy a different fan, but certainly not for the noise it is making as it is completely tolerable.  I decided to go with the Video built in to the CPU (Intel 4600) and did not buy a separate video card.  Win7 Performance Index for video is 6.7, far better than what I was getting on my old machine.

Hard to say much more about it than that.My one complaint is that it runs VERY HOT with the stock fan/heat sink installed. Even without overclocking, the stock cooler couldn't keep it under 90-95C at full load, which is totally unacceptable. I reseated it and cleaned/reapplied thermal compound multiple times just to make sure it wasn't my mistake. A gigantic third party heat sink (Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO) brought the temperature down to about 65C, which seems to be about as good as it gets for this processor without liquid cooling. It's not a huge additional expense, but it makes me wonder why they include the stock cooler at all. It's just extra stuff to throw away, and I bet it could have been a few bucks cheaper without it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The shipping time also took less than a week.The only problem was that motherboards with LGA 1700 sockets (that supports 12gen Intel processors) are currently much more expensive than LGA 1200 or AMD counterparts, so I had to settle with a non ideal mATX motherboard to stay within my budget.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent.  It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming.  I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine.  I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup.

"Intel Core i5-12400 Desktop Processor 18M Cache, up to 4.40 GHz LGA 1700 Socket",No review title,Reviewed in the United States on 13 May 2023,I wasn't expecting much out of this CPU but it runs 3D CAD software better than my old i7-6700k and completely blows it out of the water with rendering and tool path generation.  For the price it's dang near perfect.  It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs.  It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7,1.0 out of 5 stars

And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests.

Very good gaming performance. Will not bottleneck your GPU. Even if you have a 3080\3070 Ti, or a 6800\ 6800XT this CPU will deliver great performance. I have bought 2 so far and I even paired them with a budget ASRock B660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with  135W PL2. This CPU will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great IPC performance and is compatible with DDR5 RAM. All this for approx $180-220 is a bargain. If you don't need to overclock or don't want to spend a great deal of money this is the CPU for you.

Déjà parce qu'il était destiné à être placé dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliqué, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/énergie.Je pense que c'est mission accomplie. En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI)  ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour résumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destiné à un usage polyvalent et économique.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Se ovviamente si cerca un prodotto entrylevel. Dalle recensioni ha prestazioni da fascia superiore di qualche anno fa, la CPU ha 4 core con HT quindi gestisce 8Th.L'ho acquistata per un secondo PC in un case micro-ATX con una sola 92mm posteriore in estrazione. Come prestazioni e reattività la CPU è veramente niente male navigazione, riproduzione. Ho fatto qualche bench tipo CPUZ e va un pò di più del mio R5 1600 in multi (6c/12t) e molto di più in ST.In buona sostanza se cercate una CPU per uso navigazione, riproduzione, produttività leggera, gaming (magari retrogaming su giochi DX11) è il prodotto giusto. Se fate gaming su giochi moderni (DX12) e con obiettivo di refresh sostenuti (anche minimi) allora meglio un 12400 o superiore (parlando di Intel).Ho fatto dei test con Intelburntest e la CPU resta a 4,089GHz su tutti i core con T di 75° in inverno e 82° a Luglio. Premetto che uso il dissi stock ho solo cambiato la pasta termica (arctic MX4).  La ventola tende a girare un po' veloce per tenere la T sotto controllo, comunque non è rumorosissima anzi.

Was a software issue, not a hardware issue.NEW REVIEW (5 Stars):I'm a video editor, and I usually only upgrade once every 5-7 years, and this thing more than DOUBLES the performance of my old i5 7600K 4C/4T CPU from 2017.  6P/4E cores for under $200. Wow. I was able to pick this thing up for $150 on Black Friday in 2023 and it's worth every penny.Paired it with a Deepcool AK400 cooler which I picked up for around $30 and it keeps temps around 70-75 while running Cinebench and other similar benchmarks (it's worth noting, however, that I haven't overclocked it).This with a $300 RTX 3060 from MSI with 12GB of VRAM and I have a beast of a 4K Premiere Pro workhorse that should keep me happy for another 5-7 years.A quick note if you use Premiere Pro and aren't aware:If you use Premiere Pro, you absolutely NEED the K series of intel chips. Do NOT cheap out and get an intel chip without an iGPU! The integrated graphics chips in the K series have decoders specifically designed for h264 footage to decode that footage in Premiere Pro, allowing for buttery-smooth playback on your timeline with little to no dropped frames.According to benchmarks, without the iGPU, you can see as much as a 20-30% drop in such tasks! Do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20-$30 to get that iGPU for decoding! (You'll still need a good dedicated GPU to handle GPU-intensive effects.Hope this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith.

I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Install was easy & doesn't have the annoying fragile socket pins older CPUs used to have. You just place it on the socket close the bracket install your cooler & it should be good to go. I seem to have very good frame rate stability & seems to be able to handle most games even without a GPU. If a game used to be on console it'll likely work with this CPU & perform better than gaming console CPUs. I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price. Was going to go with an i7 13700K this ended up costing half the price of the i7 & an i7 may be a bit overkill for most of the games I plan on playing on my PC anyway.

Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works.

I should have assumed that the CPU was solid and waited on the purchase of the motherboard for a more timely handling of the computer build and testing. Having to buy computer parts a little at a time, doesn't always work out so well and I didn't want to have to break it up into three separate orders, but of course that's exactly the way it's working out anyway. I pay as I go, which doesn't do much for my credit rating and high interest credit cards are not a viable choice either.

This is pretty much my main computer. It replaced an AMD 9750 that always ran super hot and was a dog.  I got tired of trying to keep that thing cool so I was sold on the low TDP of this chip which I didn't need to overclock and the newest architecture.  I hooked this up with an MSI gaming 3 motherboard and 16GB of Corsair 3200Mhz memory.  The system is like night and day.  It runs super cool with the stock cooler in my HTPC case.  I ran Prime95 for awhile and it topped out around 60C.  I have not done any gaming yet but I can run every program I could find, VLC video, youtube, Plex, virus scan, tons of chrome browser tabs open...etc all at the same time with no problems.

This is probably the best price-to-performance ratio processor available on the market right now. It plays right along with other processors just fine and makes an EXCELLENT gaming processor.For those wondering, I have been testing this processor's onboard graphics (involuntarily, unfortunately, as I'm waiting for my GPU to arrive), and I'm shocked by the gaming performance that I've been able to get out of it. here's a couple games for reference:Black Ops III at 1080p, rendered slightly lower, on medium graphics settings - 38fps avg (not amazing, but most certainly playable)Borderlands 2 at 1080p, high-settings - 48fps or higher.World of Tanks on Medium with HD Texture pack option - 42fps avg. Again, not amazing, but most certainly playable any day of the week.Needless to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with this CPU and in a pinch, it can be used to game on its own if you're looking to save up after initial purchase for a new GPU later on.

You can't sell it if you can't build it because you can't build it it's because you don't have the material.

I paired his with a GTX 1660 super and it performs pretty well, not as good as a 12400 or Ryzen 5 3600 or 5600x, but very close. Only downside going with a 10th gen instead of 11 or newer is the lack of PCIe and m.2 gen 4 support, although neither PC needs those features as neither will saturate the bandwidth of gen 3 fully. The integrated graphics will run some light games (among us, CSGO, etc. ) At lowered settings. The included cooler is as bad as it's always been, it works, loud and temps aren't great, but it works.

Glad to see the i5 now has hyperthreading, thanks to AMD. But, I may have gotten the worst performing 10400, as my Cinebench R20 and R15 scores are noticeably lower than the benchmarks you'd see online (both single core and multi core and I've got all my drivers/bios installed and up to date). Regardless, I'm very happy with this purchase as this CPU is no slouch. Currently have it paired with an Asus Prime B460-Plus and a Zotac GTX 1070. Be aware that there's two versions of the i5-10400. One has G1 stepping (pure 6 core chip and no STIM) and the other has Q0 stepping (10 core chip with 4 cores disabled, uses the newer thermal interface and shares the similar heat spreader from the higher-end unlocked SKUs). Though, the two should perform very similarly.Update 9/9/20: Went to the previous generation platform and currently using an i9-9900K. 10th generation ain't too bad, but it's best to wait on 11th generation Rocket Lake. It's rumored to use a 14nm backport of WIllow Cove... or just wait on Zen 3.

With so many processor choices on the market, the trick is finding a balance between price and power. For me, the 10400 was the perfect balance. A lot of reviews are recommending the AMD Ryzen processors, but it seems most of these reviews are geared to gamers. Unfortunately, the latest Ryzen processors do not include graphics processing on board, and the reviews ignore this point because gamers always include a graphics card in their builds. Well I am not a gamer, and don't need to waste money on a graphics board. So the fact that the 10400 comes with onboard graphics was a selling point for me. I play WoW, and have no problems playing with the integrated UHD chipset. With 6 cores and hyperthreading, this processor is like buying a previous-generation i7. I can run multiple virtual machines on my desktop with no slowdown whatsoever. Nor do I want to overclock, since reliability is more important to me than squeezing a few more clock cycles. I think this hits the perfect balance between power and affordability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i5-7500 LGA 1151 7th Gen Core Desktop Processor,5.0 out of 5 starsTerrific midrange CPU for everyday use!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2017","Just built a new system and I wanted to make sure I had the latest generation CPU available.  Coming from a 7 yr old AMD Athlon II system, this CPU is a substantial upgrade.  I have detailed the complete listing of parts used below.  I use my desktop for Audio Production (multitrack recording/mixing/mastering) so quad cores are important.  I researched all the latest CPUs (AMD and Intel) and for the money, the Intel kept coming out ahead in terms of benchmarking. I was holding out for AMD's Ryzen CPUs but ultimately I decided it was time to move to the standard in processors.  I read there are still a few bugs to work out on the new AMDs and I will keep an eye out in the next couple of years as to how they compare to Intel's offerings.  I don't have allegiance either way but I just want performance without having to overclock and install pricey water cooling systems. I also do a bit of video editing/conversion and I can tell you this CPU is very fast.  With the MSI board and Samsung M.2 SSD, this system boots up in 20 secs.  I would be faster if I turned on the Fast Boot feature on the mobo but it's not that big of a deal.  When converting a MKV to MP4 (480i) in Handbrake (""23"" setting using the ""Slow"" encoding speed), I went from an average of 30 fps to over 130 fps.  I know it's not fair to compare a 7 yr old AMD quad to this new one but just illustrating how much of a boost in performance you can get.  I would recommend using the Cooler Master T4 instead of the stock cooler.  I'm not a fan of the cheap coolers as they tend to get noisy the harder you drive the CPU.  With the T4 installed and running Prime95, the CPU never got over 54 degrees C.  The cooler fan never went over 900 rpm so it was very quiet.  You need to make sure you have a big enough case to handle the T4 but your ears and CPU will thank you.As others have mentioned out there, you MUST have Windows 10 and a compatible motherboard with the Kaby Lake CPUs!  The MSI board immediately recognized this processor right from the start.  Also, the Kaby Lake processors recognize the DDR4 2400 memory natively so make sure to purchase the right speed.  Get every little bit of performance you can!Cheers!Windows 10 Home 64 bitMSI Gaming Intel B250 MORTAR LGA 1151 mATX MotherboardIntel i5-7500 CPU 3.4GHzSamsung 850 EVO 250GB M.2 SATA III Internal SSDSeagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch(2) Ballistix Sport 8GB Single DDR4 2400ASUS Blu-Ray Writer BW-16D1HTANEWKODI USB WiFi Adapter AC600MbpsThermaltake Versa H21 Mid-tower CaseEVGA 500 W1, 80+ WHITE 500W Power SupplyCooler Master Hyper T4 CPU CoolerArctic Silver Ceramique Thermal Compound***Update 2/4/2018*** - After almost a year later, this system still rocks!  Very pleased with the performance and have no regrets.  For those who mess around with DAWs, I can tell you this CPU can handle a TON of plugins!  I use Reaper 5 (64-bit) and using a mix of Waves, Steven Slate and other free plugins, this CPU doesn't flinch when you have over 40 plugins running at the same time.  My poor AMD Athlon II X4 would start to struggle once I hit the 40+ mark on plugins.  Some of the Waves and Slate plugins do need more processing power but so far, this CPU has handled everything I've thrown at it.  The only limitation I could see is if you run some high end samplers.  I do run Superior Drummer 3 connected to my V-drums and I would say the sampler is more of a drain on my memory but it does steal some cycles on the CPU.  I still wholeheartedly recommend this CPU for everyday use along with video/audio production work.  Again make sure to pair it with a large heatsink like the T4.  In the right case, you don't even hear the fan running once you start hitting the CPU harder.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i5-7500 LGA 1151 7th Gen Core Desktop Processor,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat all around CPU,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2017","Rebuilt the in-laws computer with this. Upgrading from a build made years ago using the A4-3300, 8GB DDR3 1600mhz ram and a 2.5 inch HDD I had laying around. Suffice it to say their old system was SLOW. The use it for really basic stuff, basically email and internet, but I wanted to make something snappy enough for them to last many years and that would age well.I chose to build using:-Intel i5 7500-MSI B250M PRO-VDH-Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (8GB x2) 3200mhz DDR4 RAM-Samsung 960 EVO 250GB SSDI reused their 430 watt Antec PSU, Rosewill mATX case, an LG sata DVD drive and a card reader.The install was quick and easy. Everything worked without a hitch from first boot to upgrading BIOS to installing Win 10 Pro and copying their data over and running updates. I doubt they will even come close to pegging this CPU but wanted to give them room to grow and figured the breathing room this would give over a dual core (even with hyper-threading) would be worth it long term.My only complaints, and not worth taking stars off for are the following:-The stock coolers mounting uses some cheap plastic push pins to mount. While it appears to do the job I cant say I am confident in how much pressure it can apply to push the cooler to the CPU surface or how well it can stay in place. For now it appears to keep the tempuratures in check but I havent pushed the CPU.-Out of the retail box the bottom of the cooler has thermal paste pre-applied but is not covered by plastic or anything so in the course of packing and shipping there are tiny fibers of what I assume is cardboard or dust all along the contact surface and on the paste. Having used high end coolers for my own builds and seeing those having covered surfaces that are polished to a shine without foreign elements on the surface this was a little unnerving. Doesnt seem to have had any negative effect afaik but for $200 itd have been nice if they could have attempted to protect the surface with $.05 of plastic.In ending I would recommend this as a decent all around processor for every day use, multimedia, office work and maybe even in a relatively budget gaming build (however for ~$30 more you can get an unlocked i5 7600k and overclock it to squeeze out more performance).",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i5-7500 LGA 1151 7th Gen Core Desktop Processor,"3.0 out of 5 starsGood for New builds of mid-low tier pc, not good for upgrading processor. Go I7 or AMD.","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2018","I recently purchased this CPU to replace my i3-7100 which runs at 3.88 GHz.The installation process was easy and this comes with a stock cooler, but I did have some cons about the item. I ended up returning it and just buying the I7-7700K and purchasing a cooler off of newegg since the Kaby Lakes do not come with a coolerThe item (I5-7500) made running multiple programs at once easier as I like to stream not only on twitch but to my friends when we are on discord (via Screen Sharing). The downfall was that I did not experience better frames nor did my computer run any faster. These games included Battlefield 4, Fortnite, My time in Portia, and Player UnknownBatteground (or PUBG for short). When I tested my systems overall performance with NovaBench.exe which in my opinion is a great alternative to a 3 hour stress test, the results shocked me. My systems overall score with the I3 was 1658 and with the I5 it was 1593. The CPU score was lower as well with the I5 as well as all other components (GPU, RAM, and Memory). Even after flashing my bios with new drivers for my MOBO and reinstalling windows the results were the same.I recommend this processor only if you are planning on upgrading from a lower generation processor or if you want to newly build a mid-low end gaming pc for a first build since it is a great price. But if you are looking for bang, I would recommend AMD or just simply investing more money for an I7 so you won't end up having to drop more money in the next couple years to upgrade again. Overall, was an okay experience but I did return it 2 days after installation since the results I got were disappointing. Not a bad processor, not a good one either.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i5-7500 LGA 1151 7th Gen Core Desktop Processor,"3.0 out of 5 starsIt's fine, not great. Let's not reward Intel for making absolutely no progress at all.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2017","Now, my 3 stars isn't because this product is in any way bad. As Amazon suggests, ""it's OK"". This doesn't set the world on fire. It runs things smoothly, period. Some hitches here and there when the CPU seems to be thinking twice about what it's about to do, otherwise fine. Fine, is not OMG AMAZING 5 STARS. It's just that, fine. The 3 stars are because this product, is a joke. IT's the exact same performance as the previous generation, and nobody should give Intel a pass on this behavior. Now that AMD is competing with Ryzen, 8th gen is adding cores. Look at that, suddenly Intel is doing something, anything. That, however, did not happen with Kaby lake, literally 0% performance gains, and for that, you get 3 stars - a mere fine.Not only that - I sold my GPU and spent about 2 weeks with integrated CPU graphics (Intel HD 630) until I bought a GTX1060. I use a 4K screen, which was well supported at 4K30. However, lowering the resolution to 1440p, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get it working at 60fps. Mind you, this CPU is sold and advertised as supporting HDMI1.4 spec, which covers up to 1440p60. No way to get it working. These 2 weeks were spent chatting with Intel support to figure this out, and while they at least made efforts to solve it, nothing (everything else in this build has been used with previous GPUs/monitors up to 4K60, so the rest of the hardware was fine, this was clearly the HD 630's fault). This is a big, big problem, whether it's due to driver support or otherwise, I do not know, but it's certainly unacceptable and nothing that will earn this product an amazing review. It's fine. It did its job, kind of, except when it failed to deliver.I bought this CPU because I had already purchased DDR4 for my new build this past spring, and Ryzen's growing pains with memory support prevented me from using the memory on their motherboards. I didn't want to wait until support came along, so I made an Intel build. In a couple years, we'll see who gets my money: either Intel gets back into the game and innovates some, or I'll make sure I buy AMD the next round.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Huge upgrade from my previous AMD FX-6300 (duh). I probably should have gotten the ""K"" series to be overclockable, but I was on a budget and forced myself not to spend the extra $30. Would have been worth it. I didn't use the OE fan cooler. I put an NZXT Kraken X42 on it. Keeps it around 28C at idle and under 60C while gaming. It's easy to say it's the best processor I've used as it's the newest and has the best technology of any I've used. For the money I feel it was a good purchase.The new Kaby Lake architecture does require Windows10, and I was a little worried as I was still using Windows7. After loading it and starting to use it I actually like Windows10.

Intel Core i5-7500 LGA 1151 7th Gen Core Desktop Processor,4.0 out of 5 starsCan power VR with ease.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2017","I bought this CPU, along with a GTX 1080 FE, to power a dedicated mobile VR platform that I can take to peoples houses for parties, etc.  Not commercial grade, but just for letting friends play with VR for a few days.  I mounted these in a Micro ATX case with a handle for ease of mobility.Since space was at a premium, I was also concerned with cooling solutions.  I decided to go with air cooling for everything (less weight, less complexity) and that was the deciding factor on choosing an I5 over an I7, and I don't regret it.So far the combo of this I5 with a standard GTX 1080 FE has performed perfectly.  Many hours of playing VR games, even outdoors, and it doesn't have heat issues.  There's no issues with VR games though now with Fallout 4 VR, I feel I'd like to kick it up to a 1080 TI.Overall, this processor has exceeded my expectations.",5.0 out of 5 stars

After  few months I can say that this CPU gives zero problems, no issues, no throttling. Good performance and features on a mature and optimized platform that works well even with demanding games if that's what you care about.  Even the HD 630 iGPU is able to play games like Mafia II and Bioshock, I didn't expect that. Paired with a dedicated GPU there's nothing to worry about with this CPU whatsoever.

Onboard intel 530 hd graphics on par with nvidia 2xx gtx. So its ok. Can run some games but nothing new. To be honest I expect a little better from a 6th gen processor but it is still decent. This cpu can be a mid gen cpu. This skylake cpu is also a ram compatibility issue as it only accepts DDR3L and DDR4 so no putting old ddr3 memory in. As the expression goes, a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link so if you bought this cpu with a powerful gpu and ram, this cpu will hold you back a bit than other cpus. However this is fine watching videos, light servering, and a little gaming. Again the cpu is a 2.7 GHZ and future games will probably require a 3.0 ghz cpu quad core or higher so unless you are overclocking, this cpu might not be best for gaming.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Se siete alla ricerca di un processore con ottime prestazioni in ambito lavorativo o gaming (senza troppe pretese) questo processore fa per voi. Sconsigliato per chi fa grafica o video editing ad alte risoluzioni. La frequenza di lavoro ha un range di lavoro abbastanza ampio (da 2.7 GHz a 3.3 GHz) e la modalità turbo è automatica quindi sarà lui ad aumentarla automaticamente se sotto stress. Questo vi consente di risparmiare energia quando il carico di lavoro non è eccessivo (per esempio navigare su internet). Il dissipatore ingrato è di buona qualità e riesce a tenere le temperature nella norma, in particolare se la scheda madre ha una gestione intelligente delle ventole. Il processore grafico integrato è ottimo ma in coppia con una scheda grafica dedicata riesce a gestire anche giochi abbastanza pesanti (per gli fps a quel punto dipende molto dalla scheda grafica).

Dalle notevoli prestazioni permette di eseguire qualsiasi operazione con una velocità di calcolo disarmante, il consumo in termini di energia assorbita è ridotto ormai ai minimi termini ed affiancato ad una scheda video prestante regala forti emozioni anche ai giocatori più estremi. Dal costo assai contenuto rispetto alle prestazioni che offre attualmente si colloca ai primi posti per quello che riguarda il rapporto qualità prezzo. Corredato del classico dissipatore stock non necessita nemmeno di una particolare attenzione in merito al suo raffreddamento in quanto come già accennato in precedenza è ottimizzato per offrire il massimo delle prestazioni sfruttando il minimo delle risorse.

I am going from AMD which I have never owned an Intel.  I have been having a hell of time experiencing some issues with getting everything up and running.  Anyway, after i got everything up and connected with double and triple checking connections... the machine booted up and then powered right back off.  After digging into some research, on the back on my motherboard box I noticed that it supports 6th and 7th edition Intel CPU's..... this CPU is 8th edition ...but has 1151 socket.  My point here.... the socket type should match up with the motherboard and SHOULD work, but to me Intel is greedy and wants more money .... so you have to buy special mobos..... just my two sense here.So thankfully amazon is cool as shit, they are awesome with refunds btw.  I returned that mobo for one that supports 8th edtion Intel CPU 1151 socket.  After I got all of it connected again... it would start up and go right back off.....but this time the CPU light above the 24 pin power connecter was lighting up.  Come to find out.... the CPU was DOA , or something happened when I fired it up in the other MOBO that didn't support the 8th edition Intel CPU.Got my fingers cross as I have exchanged the CPU for an replacement.  I know some of this is my fault ....but I'm not taking all of the blame here haha!  If a CPU says 1151 socket... plain and simple... the MOBO that accepts 1151 socket should work!!!!!!!  I shouldn't have to dig into all the particular info on the mobo and find out every little detail to see if the CPU will match and work with the MOBO.... stupid !!  I'm done venting.... wish me luck when the replacement CPU comes in.ps: Will change review after getting the CPU up and running and actually testing it out compared to my FX 8 core AMD that I have had.CPU works, review changed as this CPU paired with my system is 100 billion percent faster.

Top 3","Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2019","Quite good, one of the best for games currently. Top 3 right now are 8700k, 9700k and 9900k, and you can include 8086k (if you can find it), but it will be around $600, and who wants that when you got 9900k for ~$510I had 8700k fail on me, so I replaced it with 9700k, 8700k was hotter, but needed less voltage if you were to set it at 4.7 ghz, on 9700k I can't even keep CPU stable at 1.3volts for 4.7, on 8700k I could at 1.21 volts. Feel the difference?Thermals are better on 9700k, with same cooling, if comparing to 8700k. It is slightly faster in games then 8700k, but slightly slower anywhere else while using PC.If you are choosing between the two you can't go wrong with either, but mine cannot even keep stock settings without crashing games. 8700k ran stable, needed less voltage too, so it was cooler because of less volts.I didn't feel like overclocking 8700k to 5.0, I kept it nice and cool. I can't downclock 9700k to anything in comparison. So I kept it stock, but it kept crashing in AIDA 64 with hardware failure message. Also getting bluescreens, etc.I do believe I got a bad chip/bad silicone this round, so I am returning this, and bought 9900k as a replacement.If you get a good 9700k chip, you will get better gaming experience than 8700k. If you stream and do rendering get 8700k, but in Adobe Premiere 9700k is better, because it has real cores, and not threads, so in other words both are good, but neither is better than another.The best for gaming now is 9900k, but you need better cooling. 8700k was quiet hot, and needed more cooling in comparing to 9700k.Hope that helps you choose.As long as you get good chip 8700k/9700k will be perfectly fine. I like 8700k better because it was snappier altogether, but 9700k was better in games.So yeah...both goodBut leaving 4 stars due to getting bad chip, it could have been higher, but I am not gambling with my time no more.9700k is soldered, 8700k is not soldered, so this is why 9700k is cooler.

Intel Core i7-8700 Desktop Processor 6 Cores up to 4.6 GHz LGA 1151 300 Series 65W,5.0 out of 5 starsOne of the best Lakes Intel has produced.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2017","Pros:-Easy with either Intel XTU or programs that supports overclocking. Motherboards with overclocking support and UEFI also easy.-Wide stable clock range, like advertised: 3.7 Ghz to 4.8 Ghz. IMO, a future-proof consumer CPU- 6 Cores 12 threads. Multitasking is ever more easy peasy. Although there are several CPUs that has more core and threads, but those prices are for business purposes, I believe.Cons:-Just like other testers have found out, temps can be crazy. At idle, without any tampering/delidding of the CPU, it runs at 27 centigrade even with MSI Frozr Core L (Air cooler) and Gelid Xtreme thermal compound. Running Prime95 for 15 minutes, full load went close up to 80 centigrade. Heat is death for every computer component. Some CPUs previous to this one can run idle temps lower than ambient with just an air cooler and decent thermal compound.-Because of the wide clock range, there is little room for going above 4.8 Ghz. However, my current setup cannot fully test the clock ceiling of the component without possibly destroying it. I’ve came to this conclusion based off articles and enthusiast testers.-Price. Maybe. It’s the new hype for many Intel customers. And also availability. This will be remedied soon enough, as Intel plans to make more assembly line in places, which probably lowers the price.Other Thoughts:Upgrading from i7-2600, (non K mind you) this component is the answer for me. It is, as some previous iterations of the 14 nm lithography, as an optimized and core/thread-added CPU. Basically, it is a minor upgrade if you are already within the 14 nm tech.TLDR: I like this CPU coming from a 2nd gen i7.Current rig:Fractal Design Define R5 Windowed, with x2 140mm Case FansMSI Z370 Gaming M5 Motherboard.MSI Core Frozr L Air CoolerNvidia GTX 970 GPUG.Skill DDR4-3600Mhz 16GB Memory ModuleEVGA 600W 80+ Silver PSU non-modularGelid Solutions Xtreme Thermal Compound.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Item was listed as new.  Showed up quickly, but when I opened the box, I was met with a strange CPU box that clearly stated, ""This Is Not Original Intel Packaging.""Okay....  So I crack it open and take a look.  The CPU fan was damaged upon arrival.  Didn't have any faith in it as it looked pretty bad from the top, and the insides looked a bit dusty as well.  I was starting to doubt this ""New"" item status.  The CPU was in a plastic tray, and clearly had a fingerprint on it.  Again....not looking too new boss.Since I had no faith in the included air cooler, I decided to install a better one that uses a tower style radiator with a 120mm fan.  Fired the PC up and had to update my nVidia graphics card drivers.  Had my temp monitoring software open and saw one of the CPU cores was hitting 100c.  Holy cow.  And I was just doing driver installs.  No way would I trust trying to run a game or something like Cinebench to see what would happen.  And I know this tower cooler is more than enough as I've cooled much higher TDP CPUs with it.So, I'm returning this thing.  I highly doubt this thing is new by any stretch of the imagination.

I can't complain about it. It was as all processors; easy to install. I got this with a motherboard and I can safely tell you that I don't regret my upgrade. I built my PC about three years ago shortly after the release of the 6600k and 6700k and stupidly, I skimped on processing power and went with the 6600k thinking ""I'll just overclock it as far as I can safely take it with watercooling"" and thought I'd be fine. Well, I was for a while, but three years is a lot, and with that constant overclock, while I wasn't noticing anything ""bad"" I was just noticing I wasn't getting as much out of it. So I upgraded, a thing I wouldn't be doing had I gone with the best processor in the first place. Lesson learned.So here's what I think. The ease at which you can overclock this particular processor is absolute. It's great. You can't get much better unless your motherboard has onboard profiles for maximum overclock, but what kind of scrub doesn't do it manually? (Well, me, this time...)Unfortunately, without a beefy cooling solution, you have yourself a radiator in the winter and a nuisance in the summer, and so I bought myself a box fan to set under my desk pointed at my tower to deal with this. Yes, I could buy a new cooling solution (I use an AIO that's now just over 3 years old, I know this is what I have to do) but right now can't swing the cost.

Personally I think it functions best as a gaming CPU due to how well it overclocks combined with how well it performs in single thread benchmarks compared to most multi-core CPUs. Worth noting that the 8700k's single thread speed is comparable to the 7700k. Although the 8700k is a bit more future proof due to two extra cores it has over the 7700k. The biggest downside i've experienced is that this CPU can and WILL run hot so be prepared to buy top of the line cooling. Preferably water cooling.Overall the CPU itself is excellent and checks off most of boxes in things you want out of a CPU. The biggest problem is how expensive things become when you factor in all the things you'll probably need to buy. Remember at the very least that you'll need to buy an entirely new motherboard with the 8700k. Potentially DDR4 and a high end cooling solution assuming you don't already own these. Due to the price I would only advise upgrading to this if you are currently running on an extremely dated CPU.

The system I built a couple years ago was pretty good but I soon realized the I7 6700 I had picked with a max turbo speed of 3.7 GHz on all the cores  was not up to the task of making my GPU work hard and it was pretty slow at content creation as well.  I went back and forth between Intel and AMD and eventually settled on this processor.  The difference is night and day.  The I7 8700 is able to officially turbo to 4.3 GHz on all 6 cores and with sufficient cooling can do that all day long.  I say officially because my mobo has a ""performance mode"" in the BIOS which, according to CPUz, is allowing the CPU to turbo to 4.4 GHz on all cores when I'm gaming and it holds it steadily.  My GPU went from 55 to 60% usage in Planetside 2 to 99% and my average frame rate at 1080p went from 90-100 FPS to 130-140 FPS.  Rendering times were also reduced by a fair margin.

Chip not delidded. The chip does really well at gaming and even multitasking, my only oddity is that my system does not like tighter timing on the ram. I decided to disable XMP and manually overclock the ram but when I tighten the timings from 16-16-16-38 to 15-15-15-36 and DRAM voltage at 1.4v, the system will not boot.

Performs great for gaming and general use. 6 cores with 12 threads also enable multiple processes to be executed effectively. Easy to overclock, typically up to 5 Ghz with 5.1 Ghz usually possible, but this increases TDP from 95W, so you might need to get a new cooler for this.Standard clock per active core: 4.7 Ghz Single Core, 4.6 Ghz Two Core, 4.5 Ghz Three Core, 4.4 Ghz Four and Five Core, and 4.3 Ghz Six Core.Only margainally less capable than the ~$75 more i7 8086k, which has a Single Core clock of 5.0 Ghz stock (the rest is the same). The i7 8700k is a better value, but if you have tons of money to blow and/or want a special edition, the i7 8086k is at least as good.Comparable only to the more than twice the price AMD Thread Riper 1950X in gaming and desktop performance, but cannot compare as a workstation (as the TR has 16 cores and 32 threads).Gaming Example: GTA V Ultra running at ~15-35% CPU usage with peaks of 40-50%.

Intel's ""toothpaste"" between the die and heatspreader is just not acceptable. A powerful cooler or a delid is a must, especially if overclocking, to maintain comfortable temps.At first I used my old Hyper 212, and at stock settings this thing could reach 80c if pushed hard enough. No room for overclocking. Opted for a Noctua D15s, and things are very much under control now (iirc a short Aida64 cpu+fpu stress peaked around 75c but backed off to around 65-70).

I'm not an overclocker, so I didn't get the K version, but the 8700 is a great device.  It runs noticeably cooler than the 7700 in a friends PC (the transistor pitch is bigger on the 8700, making it's thermal characteristics better, but it's on a bigger die).I play a lot of simulations, where the processor is generally the bottleneck (it doesn't matter how fast your graphics board is, if the processor can't calculate the physics fast enough, you're frame rate will drop), but this brute forces it's way through.I'm extremely impressed with this.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i5-3570 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 6 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570,5.0 out of 5 starsOne of my best buys,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2014","I upgraded from Pentium G620 and the difference is H-U-G-E ! 4 cores @ 3400 Mhz with a sweet overclocked gtx 660 gpu and my custom-built PC is just the gaming machine I needed. Definitely recommended for those who don't want to do overclocking and experimenting. Cheaper than the K version, newer model, and their only difference is that the K has better integrated graphics and is able to overclock. Also this cpu has some extra features the K version doesn't. And btw integrated graphics suck anyway.P.S: For those of you who chose to upgrade to this cpu and are using windows 7 , make sure after the installation, that your cpu is running on 4 cores. Sometimes the system can't read more than 1 core if the previous cpu was 1 core. Google for more information ;) hope i helped !",5.0 out of 5 stars

Combined with the board, ram and video card I have, I'm seeing an average of 100fps in games.Diablo 3, WoW and Battlefield are ten times more playable.  Loving it.  For $200 you can't go wrong.

I am thinking that there might be some glitch in the viewer, since my Pentium G640 started to peg earlier, which is why I upgraded.Otherwise it tears through anything I sick it on.The one MAJOR issue I had was not the fault of the CPU, but an obscure setting in my HP P6-2220t, which came with a dual core cpu (Pent.G640)It only allowed 2 cores to function. ""Task Manager"" only saw 2. ""Speccy"" only saw 2, Etc. I thought I had a dud and was attempting to return it when I learned something;There is a setting that limits the machine to 2 cores. It is located in Run/Msconfig/boot/advanced options. MAKE sure that the little box ""number of processors"" is NOT CHECKED!!!!!  If it is, then uncheck it and reboot.

Intel Core i5-3570 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 6 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570,No review title,"Reviewed in Italy on August 26, 2015","Questo processore è oramai 'vecchio' secondo gli standard del mondo PC ma vi assicuro che è ancora una bomba , che non sfigura minimamente coi fratelli più giovani (4570 - 4670 e 4690) anzi le prestazioni sono quasi identiche , cambia solo il supporto a nuove funzioni che questo non ha ed una gpu integrata molto più performante, ma veramente poca roba .

Intel Core i5-3570 Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 6 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570,No review title,"Reviewed in Spain on January 17, 2013","Este procesador es el ""compañero"" del i5 3570K: la principal diferencia entre los dos es que los procesadores de la serie K tienen el multiplicador desbloqueado para que, en placas que cuenten con soporte para overclocking (casi todas las de gama media en adelante) puedas subir la frecuencia base y variar el multiplicador con el que se obtiene la frecuencia de funcionamiento del procesador.Hay, sin embargo más diferencias: los procesadores i5 3570, sin K, soportan tres tecnologías orientadas a la virtualización y seguridad por hardware más Hyper Threading. Las cuatro tecnologías son: Intel vPro para implementar sobre todo la seguridad por cifrado en las comunicaciones, Intel VT-d para la virtualización de interfaces de entrada/salida que mejora el rendimiento de dispositivos de comunicación virtuales, Intel TXT para ejecución cifrada de código indispensable para usar un TPM e Hyper Threading, que contextualiza la caché del procesador desdoblando cada núcleo físico de la CPU en dos virtuales. Es interesante observar que estas características están directamente traídas de la gama Xeon de procesadores para workstation y servidores, y que puede ser muy interesante para entornos de trabajo donde sean necesarias, como redes VPN seguras o entornos de desarrollo. Como este procesador es para el socket 1155, puede instalarse en una placa del año pasado para Sandy Bridge sin problemas, a costa de no tener soporte para PCI Express 3.0 ni soporte nativo para USB 3.0.Y en cuanto al rendimiento en sí de este procesador es, por supuesto, espectacular. En una época donde los procesadores son cada vez más potentes y es más difícil que se queden obsoletos para uso real (un Intel Core i5 760, por ejemplo, sigue siendo una CPU de cuatro núcleos más que solvente y lleva más de dos años en el mercado) comprar un i5 es una apuesta segura. Por supuesto, el que lo quiera para jugar debe mirar el de la serie K y aunque no se tenga ni idea de hacer overclocking, usar la función automática que incluyen la enorme mayoría de placas base con chipsets de gama media en adelante y subir el procesador de frecuencia cómodamente hasta 4,1-4,3 GHz sin necesidad de usar ningún componente especia, sólo un ventilador decente. Si se cuenta con un presupuesto muy ajustado, este procesador puede suponer un ahorro de 20€ respecto del K, y hacer atractiva su compra sólo por eso. En cualquier caso, subiendo la frecuencia o no, con este procesador tendrás CPU para rato.Por supuesto, las características de los i7 también pueden animar a los entusiastas pero dada la diferencia de precio con los 3770 yo no lo recomiendo. He probado los dos 3770, con K y el modelo normal, y prefiero sin dudarlo adquirir un i5 3570 y gastar la diferencia en otros componentes. La temperatura, que también preocupa mucho en Internet, es algo superior a la de un procesador 2500K de la generación anterior pero no es nada preocupante. Lamentablemente, los procesadores de AMD ya no son una alternativa, porque como la mayoría de aplicaciones usan uno y a los sumo dos núcleos físicos, estos procesadores rinden mucho mejor que los comparables de AMD. El Hyper Threading puede venir bien en aplicaciones muy específicas que estén preparadas para separar los procesos en muchos hilos y puedan asignarle un hilo a cada núcleo, pero para usarlo principalmente para juegos y de oficina yo lo desactivaría. Con las memorias no hay problema, incluso mezclando de distintas velocidades el controlador integrado se las arregla bien. La gráfica integrada, HD 4000, sigue siendo una gráfica poco potente pero me ha sorprendido el poder jugar a juegos 3D complejos como Fallout 3 aunque eso sí, a un nivel de detalle bajo. Para reproducir vídeos no presenta ningún problema con Windows Media Player Classic o VLC.Puntos positivos:+ Mejor relación rendimiento real/precio en los procesadores Intel Ivy Bridge actuales+ En Amazon vale 10-30€ más barato que en tiendas físicas+ Soporta tecnologías de los Intel Xeon+ Puedes usar una placa 1155 con chipsets de la serie 6, pero entonces pierdes PCI Express 3.0 y soporte nativo de USB 3.0+ La gráfica integrada es casi decentePuntos negativos:- A poco que te pongas, te cuestan igual las placas de socket 1155 que los procesadores- Se calientan un poco más que los Sandy Bridge, pero no es nada preocupante",5.0 out of 5 stars

Even my programs were freezing when I had two or more open at a time.I know people test this CPU with solid states and lots of ram so it has no bottleneck, but that's not the price point of this CPU. Most will buy a HDD or an SSHD with 8gb of ram. And for that kind of build, this CPU is slow enough that it gets stuck any time it handles files off a disk drive.My hardware isn't bad either; I'm running a 2TB Firecuda with plenty of space left on it and good SATA cables.So I'm not sure what intel is doing with this CPU, but you'd clearly be better off spending 99 on a 1st or 2nd gen Ryzen 3. Terrible terrible CPU. I've seen Pentium Processors that perform better. Maybe even Celrons.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But you also don't have to spend a whole lot to get something powerful, versatile and efficient either.  I'm not into the over clocking scene so I picked up the standard 2500 model and I have been nothing but impressed with the performance. Very few software apps are written to take advantage of more than 4 cores in the current environment, so you really don't gain a whole lot going to the 6 or 8 core competitors.  If you are really in budget territory, the i3 Sandy Bridge range is very competitive, but if you don't feel like forking out money for the 2600, this is a nice price point.  I don't think the factory cooler is very good - I opted for a Cooler Master - the processor rarely gets above 30-35c even under the highest gaming loads.

Aber das ist für alle normalen und mittelmäßigen Anforderungen genügend.Im Idle Betrieb habe ich mit einem großen Lüfter von BeQuiet Temperaturen von 32-35 Grad. Dabei muss ich dazu sagen dass ich ein silent Gehäuße habe welches stark gedämmt ist. Daher dürften bei normalen Gehäußen die Temperaturen zwischen 30 und 35 Grad liegen.Die Grafikeinheit der CPU kann einen Monitor mit 1920x1080 Pixeln beliefern Windows Aero ist (glaube ich) auch ganz normal möglich. Ein ganz klein wenig Zocken kann man auch. Bei COD MW2 lief alles bei voller Auflösung gut aber sobald Gegner kommer ruckelt es. Stellt man die Einstellungen etwas niedrigen müsste es aber ruckelfrei laufen.Für mich ist es genau das richtige Preis/Leistungsverhälltnis gewesen. Sollte die Leistung nä. Jahr nicht mehr reichen werde ich eine Intel Ivy Bridge CPU beschaffen und fertig.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,5.0 out of 5 starsThe best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2022","I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all.

AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route.

Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!",1.0 out of 5 stars

I went with an I7 build back in 2010 and that system outperforms lasting a good 8-9 years before encountering some issues with heating and performance. Compared to my current AMD build which unfortunately has only been around for 3 years experienced performance issues earlier on due to the higher demand these newer games require.Yeah I'm glad with my choice of going back to Intel. It feels like a solid choice and with the sales right now for the I7, now is a good time to buy this processor. Yeah, I'm missing out on like 4 cores of processing speeds and could maybe potentially boost the lifespan of my system by a couple of more months with the I9, but that extra hundred or so would be better spent towards a dedicated graphics card.

Just not quality.I have been using a big screen TV for a monitor my for many years and never had this issue, so I don't think it's the TV.

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it.

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

If you are going to do anything that's CPU intensive, like gaming, photo/video editing, content creation, etc, spend a few more dollars for the i5-10400 or i5-11400 which is even better.If you just want a cheap CPU for your LGA1200 motherboard consider the much less expensive G5905 or similar. Intel is sadly reducing their offerings for desktop CPUs. The 13th gen series doesn't even have an i3 let alone less expensive options (at least available retail for DIY builds). But, IMHO, this chip is an albatross. I only bought it due to supply issues as nothing less expensive was in stock.

It is a power hog, when I load something I literally see my computer slowing down for 13600k to power up. It is constantly thermal throttling to the point of blue screen of death, even though I am using it with 240 Thermaltake GlacierOne liquid cooler on a higher end Z790 board. 13600k is very unstable and absolutely requires 360 liquid cooler to handle it, even at stock speed. Sure, I can limit it and it will not affect gaming or I can turn off E-cores, but what is the point of spending so much more money then? I had an excellent experience with 12400F, no stability issues, perfect temperatures all the time. I may go back to 12400F or get 13400F, I am definitely not keeping 13600kf.In order to get a full potential of 13600k you need RTX 4090. I have a brand new RTX 4080 and it is used at 100% while playing Cyberpunk 2077, CPU was showing only at 70%. Save money and get 13400F instead or wait until 14th gen comes out later this year.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But, even if you have a beefy GPU on hand, spend the extra $30 and get the K version with onboard GPU…. Beyond making non booting systems easier to troubleshoot, it turns out that Intel’s QuickSync encoder/decoders offer benefits that even the top range NVIDIA cards do not offer.  Apps like DiVinci or Adobe Premiere can utilize Intel’s QuickSync in addition to NVIDIA transcoders, making the K cpu significantly faster in those use cases.Granted that in gaming cases the K and KF provide the same performance - but if you ever need the encoding options in the future, you’ll miss them.The K series will retain the $30 premium later on the used market when the time comes, so why not invest in the most options you can right now?",5.0 out of 5 stars

Saving money on the CPU allowed me to allocate more money to other components that would have had a greater impact on overall performance. I don’t regret skipping a more costly CPU. This gets the job done and at a cost that seems unreasonably low for what you get…but definitely not complaining!!!

I did manage to push it as far as 4.7 ghz at 1.34 or 1.35 volts, im not sure. But rather than justifying my ego I decided to play safe and and stay at 4.5 @ 1.25 volts which is a significant 1 ghz overclock than the base and a safe voltage at the same time. Im not sure if i made the right decision there but if u ask me, am i happy about it?? Well yes very much so. And yes i have experienced incresed fps in arma 3 which makes my whole experience (all the painful stress tests and the agonizing blue screens) worthwhile.

The i7 is only about 30% more powerful (don't take my word for it, google the benchmarks) and is about 50% more expensive. Did I mention the i7 is overkill or high end gaming? Sure, you could drop the extra money, but its performance you won't use.

Overclocking to 4.0 GHz with the piece of trash stock cooler, the 4690k has yet to break 45 C. I have yet to put a Hyper 212 Evo, but I'm expectingThe Intel HD Graphics 4600 integrated with the card are the best integrated graphics I've seen in DDR3 systems. With 2 channels of fast (1866 MHz) ram, it is quite possible to play 8th Generation (PS4, XO) games at comparable settings with, of course, the minor lag from ram delay.In short, this is my processor of choice for DDR3. The 4790k may be better, but it is $100 more expensive, and at that price point, the upgrade to DDR4 becomes a logical choice. Great job Intel!",4.0 out of 5 stars

My system has been super stable since day one. I'm impressed so far with the performance I'm getting from this i5 CPU. It benchmarks well and overclocks extremely easily. I'm currently running at 4.5Ghz perfectly stable. Will push it up to 4.7Ghz when a better CPU cooler has been purchased. The stock cooler is actually nicer then I expected it to be but still not designed for pushing the CPU's limits.For clarification purposes, this CPU comes with a cooler AND thermal paste already applied to the cooler.Highly recommend this processor for those of you looking to do some general computer tasks and gaming. You might want to step it up to the i7 if you're serious about video editing, otherwise this i5 will do all the serious gaming you want without a hitch.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I rocked Intel on my very first computer build and remember it to be solid but was quickly beat by my AMD Phenom II Black Edition. Recently built a brand new computer and decided to go with this i5 vs AMD and WOW what a HUGE difference!I didn't know what fast was until I made the switch from AMD to Intel again, easily 10x faster than my old cpus and could run any game right now on max settings without any issues (also have an r9 gpu to boot). A little bit more expensive than AMD, but I think the price difference is definitely more worth it for a superior quality product, I HIGHLY recommend this processor!

Especially on an unlocked processor meant for overclocking. Point in fact: running the Intel Extreme Tuning software's stress test with the stock cooler at stock speeds (3.5GHz, turbo not enabled) had my cpu breaking 90*C in less than 15seconds. With a Corsair H80i, the processor sits about 56*C after several hours of stress tests at 4GHz....Overall really great processor, just expect to throw away the fan/heatsink. :)Highly recommend, would buy again.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I didn't need the i7 CPU as I'm using my new PC build for running 2 digital audio workstations and there is no lag or any problem getting work done with this CPU. Simply put...this rock solid CPU does the job and processing is lightning fast for what I use it for. I'm impressed and satisfied that I purchased it and would highly recommend it to others.

Idles at around 31C and at full load using Prime95 it sits in the mid-50s.  If you have the extra money I'd recommend this over the AMD 8 core series.  The performance is just plain better, it uses less power, and runs cooler.

This thing is a beast for its price. the 4770k and all those other ones are fluff.However, if you can get a ""K"" version of this, I'd recommend that. I wish I could overclock this processor more, since it never even goes above room temperatureIf it helps your decision anymore, I calculated this processor's price-to-performance ratio based on single-core speeds. The i7's have 4 cores but 8 threads total, which most applications don't even use. Most applications pretty much max out at 4 single-threaded cores, which is what an i5 is. And this i5 happens to be one of the fastest i5's, which basically puts it on par with the high end core i7's which are nearly $100+ more. The hyper-threading in i7 is really not worth the extra cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,"4.0 out of 5 starsSlow shipping, faster than CPU it replaced","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2018","Took a month to arrive so minus one star. Tempted to chop off another star because I expected to get 10nm by now. But they did well enough with this yet-another-14nm CPU. Let's all take a moment of silence as Moore's law is officially laid to rest. RIP.-Performs 40% to about 100% faster on all of my workloads than the 4-year old 6-core 22nm i7-5820K it replaced.-I9 consumes only a fraction of the power and less heat at low utilization compared to that old x99 chip.-Peaks at about 176 watts after 12 minutes of running P95 torture test. Temps briefly peak in low 80's for that dated and unrealistic test. (Motherboard maker monitoring software shows mid 70's, Intel software shows low 80's...)-Except for initial setup and testing, I don't manually overclock the 9900k since that would only give me about 3% more performance than I get running optimized with no power restrictions enabled (e.g. out of  Intel TDP spec, but the common default for these early Z390 boards). Just disable the throttles and enable auto for the voltage and stuff.-5.0 GHz for common few core load for long periods, and 4.7 GHz on all cores forever under heavy load (e.g P95) is what I'm seeing with the above config. I'm just using basic H115i PRO AIO cooling and have yet to see any workload force throttling to the official 3.6 GHz speeds.-Times have really changed since my hard core overclocking days 20 years ago. With throttles disabled, the CPU does exactly what I would want to achieve. It's organic overclocking virtually out of the box. Turbo boosts to workload optimized fantastic speeds when needed, reduces down to less than 25 watts TPD when not under stress even while still hitting 5.0 Ghz. I don't have to do any switching or adjustments between workloads. No distractions. Perfect!-Unlike the much more expensive xx99 chipsets, Z390 enables Intel onboard GPU with Quick Sync for better performance and lower CPU utilization/power consumption, which is something I have long missed for some of my workloads, one of which runs 24x7.-Seems to be a great price if you compare to x299 platform prices. Thanks to AMD's innovation, Intel is cannibalizing its own HEDT segment.It's marketed as a gaming CPU, but IMHO it's a great choice for workstation needs. There's a lot of frustration in the 12-year-old-at-heart gaming community with this chip. It's expensive for that market segment especially with prices inflateddue to the 14nm shortage, it lacks much innovation over last year's offering which upsets the frequent must-have-the-latest upgraders, and there's really not that much headroom for overclocking without industrial cooling equipment.If you have an older (3 years+) CPU and looking to rebuild your system and want to invest in a high performing chip at a comparably reasonable price (compared to x299/HEDT platform and adding in extra cost due to the 14nm supply shortage), I9-9900K is a fine choice that gives you the latest and greatest. It's a safe bet since Intel's 10nm performance chips are likely now a 2020 thing.If you want more value, get AMD's latest. We all owe AMD's innovation some gratitude for forcing Intel to offer this 8-core chip in this segment. Long live AMD.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,4.0 out of 5 starsOnly if you use the extra cores.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2019","Edit follow up:  After about 3 weeks of running this and my 8700K machines side by side on a cloned M.2 SSD PCIe I quite literally don't have any differences to compare against.  I can run anything on one that the other runs, and the performance is sooooo similar I can't tell which is which.  Same exact GTX 1080 in both, same memory.  There is maybe a 20 second difference with the 9900K while rendering a massive video edit, but what's 5 minutes vs. 5 minutes 22 seconds.  For perspective, my Ryzen 1950x Threadripper build did it in 3 minutes 11 seconds, and costs about $50 more.  If that helps, great.  Personally, it serves no new purpose and has no advantages over the 8700K.Original review:I don't care about gaming, an i5 built right is plenty for that.  I do video/audio production, so in this case I see a difference over the i7 8700k I've been using.  BUT, I have a Ryzen 1950X Threadripper that noticeably outruns both (and a 6850K and a 5930K on X99 chripsets).  There is only a $20 difference between this i9 and the Threadripper now at other sellers, and I can't rationalize this processor.  Any recent processor can game just fine (mine's an 8600, rarely used), and this is certainly no better than that in real time.  I ran Shadow Of The Tomb Raider for a couple hours on one, then the other, couldn't tell ANY difference.  If you use the extra cores and have an i7 I'd recommend it.  My Z390 board auto OC'd  this to 5.0 out of the box, temps are better than tolerable with water cooling.  But, if you really are performance oriented (i.e. video, large project rendering, etc.) go with a Threadripper and keep an eye on AMD for the future as well.  They're working with 7nm chips already while Intel isn't even bringing 10nm to market yet.  I've been building for over 30 years now and haven't seen a shift like this before, so even I don't know what to expect.  This processor, however is not much of a leap forward in any respect... kinda like Nvidia and RTX.  More hype than performance, stop-gap rather than a step up.  I'll end up selling this one.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,4.0 out of 5 starsFast and hotter than heck,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2018","No doubt this is fast, but the cpu heat is ridiculous.

The I9 clocked at 5ghz on all coores will overwhelm it though, which likely means you would need a 360mm AIO or more likely a custom loop to cool this beast. In truth, the factory setting of the Asus motherboard were such that the standard overclock provided by Intel (5ghz on 2 cores, 4.7ghz on all) was creating temperatures in the mid 90Cs, well above where I'd prefer.I hate water coolers, and think they are overhyped in general. Definitely not worth their risk. So, I set out to maximize the system performance manually and better control the heat. In the end I was able to dial the voltage down from the Asus default, and set the core speeds to incrementally decrease as more cores load up, but still be OC. I then setup adaptive vcore voltage to further reduce temps and hopefully increase the cpu lifespan. In the end I have 1 or 2 cores at 5.2ghz, 3 or 4 cores at 5.1ghz, 5 cores at 5.0ghz,6 cores at 4.9ghz, 7 at 4.8ghz and 8 cores at 4.7ghz. I use an AVX offset of -4.  At these settings using air cooling, it tests at about 80C at each core level. AVX tests at 86C max. This leaves some headroom in case room temp is above normal. The system idles in high 20Cs to low 30Cs. Normal gaming runs in mid 50Cs to mid 60Cs.I used hwinfo, cinebench 15, occt, and prime95 while dialing in my settings.In most games he sees it hitting 5.1ghz very often, only when a game uses a lot more cores does it drop.So, it's fast, but it will take some manual work to keep your temps in line.

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,5.0 out of 5 starsBest Gaming CPU IMO,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2019","When juxtaposing the 9900k and the 2700x, you'll find that the 2700x is $200 cheaper than the 9900k, but that $200 brings a lot more to the table than a nice blue cube thing and an empty wallet. When properly cooled, the 9900k does not exceed the 65C threshold when gaming at 5GHz. I personally use the Corsair LC240E AIO Water Cooler rated for CPUs up to 230W. Saw another review where they said the Maximus XI series motherboards can't OC this to 5GHz, but I found that to be false. On both of my Maximus XI Hero (WI-FI) boards, I was able to achieve 5GHz stable with different 9900ks too. I'm unsure to the exact power draw, but at intense moments it'll reach 175w. The case is nice too, but if you order from online there's a decent chance it'll arrive in more than one piece.Some people argue that the 2700x is a CPU that can battle head-on with the 9900k. That's false. Completely. In CS:GO, a both GPU and CPU dependant game, saw a 200fps increase when standing still and up to 150fps increase during the action. The multi-threaded CPU portion works well too, seeing little to no impact when running Spotify, Chrome, and CS:GO at the same time. Cost to performance wise, the 2700x is to die for, but I have my monitor running at 240Hz and I need to keep my frames above 240, and AMD's IPS can't keep up with that, so I'll have to stick with the 9900k.Pros-wicked fast-high chance of getting to 5GHz-cool case-bragging rights-integrated? graphics?

Con un overclock de 5.0 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.38 v, llega a tener picos de 75°c en battlefield 5 cuando más se está utilizando, esto tomando en cuanta que es invierno con una temperatura ambiente  baja. Con un overclock de 5.2 ghz sin xmp offset a 1.41v, la temperatura de base es de 52°c promedio con picos en battlefield 5 de hasta 85°c con los abanicos a 1300 rpm, ya que a esa velocidad no hacen tanto ruido, podría subirlos más, pero el ruido es demaciado alto.Tomando en cuanta varias cosas, como que el AIO es bastante bueno, el que use liquid metal en lugar de pasta térmica, y la baja temperatura ambiente, el procesador produce bastante calor y esa es una de las consideraciones principales que se tiene que tener si piensas comprar este procesador; en cuanto a su rendimiento, el procesador es muy bueno, es muy caro (540 dlls más taxes y envío en algunos casos), solo por el precio y el problema del sobrecalentamiento no le doy 5 estrellas.Para que tarjeta madre usar, recomendaría cualquiera que cueste más de 200 dlls, siempre y cuando no sea ASUS, ya que su tarjeta de 280 dlls es solo de 4 caras, mientras que las MOBOs de gigabyte de 200 dlls tienen 12 caras, así que evitar a ASUS en este caso sería la mejor opción.",5.0 out of 5 stars

So I went with one of the new corsair coolers H115i or something like That, all I know it was the newest one at the time.This i9 9900k will last me for a very long time because I've been running the i7 4790k from 2014 till 2019 so I'm sure this will give me more life then that one did.At the very end would I buy this again?

Intel Core i9-9900K Desktop Processor 8 Cores up to 5.0 GHz Turbo Unlocked LGA1151 300 Series 95W,4.0 out of 5 starsExcellent CPU for gaming and computing,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019","I bought this fairly soon before AMD released their Ryzen 3 series, and admittedly, AMD's Ryzen 3 3900X sounds like a great processor for a similar price as the i9-9900K (the Ryzen has 4 more cores, 8 more threads, and sounds like it does well in benchmarks).  However, the Intel i9-9900K is a great processor.  With 8 cores and hyperthreading, the i9-9900K offers 16 threads, allowing many things to run simultaneously.  I have this processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super card (Asus ROG Strix) and a 4K monitor.  I've only played a couple games on it so far (Galactic Civilizations III and the Quake 2 RTX demo (for the Nvidia RTX 20-series cards), and they play smoothly at 4K (though the Quake 2 RTX demo seems more taxing and runs better at 1920x1080).I also sometimes run some distributed computing projects using BOINC, such as SETI@Home and World Community Grid.  SETI@Home tasks on this processor tend to take between about an hour and 15 minutes to 2 hours or so.  And with 16 threads available, BOINC will run 16 tasks at the same time, allowing plenty of work to be done.One downside of this CPU is that it can get fairly warm (from what I had read in other reviews).  I opted to get a liquid cooler for mine, a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Riig RGB 240mm.  Under a load (with BOINC), I've seen my CPU get to around 75C-81C.  When idle, I've seen mine at around 29-30C.I also sometimes do photo editing and video encoding, and this CPU helps get things done relatively quickly.Overall, this is a great workhorse CPU.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And be prepared to either get a beefy air cooler (Noctua U12s, D15, be quiet Dark Rock Pro 4) or a 360mm AiO or go full custom water cooling because this chip needs all the cooling it can get. It's HOT. VERY VERY hot.I have mine delidded (yes I delidded because the Intel STIM can't do anything to cool this CPU), and run it bare with no IHS with a direct die frame, and it's still very hot.Despite all the negative things I've said. This is a very fast chip, and if you have the money... 100% go for it. Especially if budget isn't an issue, and you want the best. Just seeing all 8 cores and 16 threads at 5.0ghz is a sight of beauty. Best part about this chip is, if you're a streamer you can choose between NVENC or x264. I'm able to run x264 in OBS on Fast preset, and I don't notice any hiccups. This chip is a champ.Hopefully Intel can bring us a little more next year, as it seems like they wont be releasing any mainstream desktop CPU's in 2019, and the only thing we'll be getting is a 9900KS (factory binned and overclocked at 5.0ghz on all 8 cores).",4.0 out of 5 stars

I’m extremely please with how fast this is. I run two screens with various applications, in addition to gaming, and haven’t noticed any stutters or signs that the system slows down. While I may not measure the data as closely as some others, I feel like it makes the whole system run much better. Of course, I upgrade from a nearly 6 year old i7-4700 so that could also be part of the astonishing difference in speed I notice.I had an issue with my GPU a few weeks ago and had to RMA it. With the Intel UHD 620 that comes in the CPU I was able to still watch high quality videos and play a few games (albeit at low graphics) while I waited for it to return. Despite the fact that the graphics were almost unbearably rough, I was very glad that the CPU had this ability and didn’t just leave me stranded.It also makes running virtual machines smooth and actually hardly seems obvious that it’s in the virtual space and not naturally installed. I have a Corsair H115i 280mm AIO CPU cooler on it and that keeps it cool at 29-31°C during nearly all operations, and only maybe peaks to near 40°C after hours of gaming.Would absolutely recommend to everyone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I did infact had to choose between this and competitor stats/ prices but I couldn't resist intels new i9-9900k. Let me reiterate on how this cpu can run my video editing software smoothly, can stream past 1920 x 1280, can pull open multiple tabs without any lag ( my current record is having 6 google chrome tabs open without a crash or lag for my intensive work I do), and the cpu basically carries the gpu in a way I wouldn't have ever thought of using it for. Gaming, which I throw in from time to time, doesn't downgrade at all or massively increase in general fps but can keep all of your incredibly open tabs and tasks open freely and a bit smoothly.

Either get an 1151 socket CPU, which the best you can get is the 9900k or get a 10th gen chip, but also buy a new motherboard AND windows 10 again (and if I go that route I might as well look at AMD).The 9900K is essentially the same as the new i7-10700k, which is much cheaper, but once you count for what else you have to replace it adds up. Lowering the price of the 9900k to be closer in price to the 10700k solidified my decision. I can keep my motherboard and not have to get a new license of windows.

I side graded to this CPU from the Threadripper 1950x and instantly saw a HUGE performance increase in both games and the Adobe Suite. Even though it has half the cores/threads (of the threadripper), the way Intel engineers their chips, there is very low latency which is very important for gaming.I run this CPU in an Asus Maximus Hero XI mobo, works very well together.Keep in mind, if you plan to use this CPU, you’re going to need a very good cooler.  I recommend an AIO (all-in-one), I have the Corsair H100i V2.  Works well, I can overclock to 5ghz with no throttling.  If you’re going to use a fan block, you most likely won’t be able to hit 5ghz, go with an AIO if you can afford it.In terms of performance, I get over 150 FPS in most AAA games (on high settings) while using the 9900k with a 1080ti and 32gb of DDR4 3000mhz RAM.If you can afford it, I would go with the i9 9900k if you’re looking for a solid workstation/gaming pc hybrid.

So, I open hardware monitor and saw my CPU temperature peaked at 100+.  I have tried different thermal transfer paste and same issue.  Then I noticed the MB was dumping up to 1.6v to the CPU.  That's horrible voltage for running it at stock speed.Here are couple things I have done in Bios to remedy the heat.Multi-core Enhancement => Disable (this is the cause of over voltage)CPU Loadline Calibration => 7 (this is to help system stabilize while tighten the cpu voltage)CPU Voltage => 1.275 (I started with 1.35v and reduce until I reach here.)My system is now peaked at 85 Celsius during stressed test and/or while playing BF5.  Looks like Frostbite Engine also utilize AVX which cause high CPU temperature.  I also did ordered 360 radiator; a 240 doesn't cut it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm very pleased with this CPU. Currently running it at 5.10 on all cores at 1.27V with a custom loop dual rez/dual 360 rad/dual pumps/Eloop Noise Blockers in a Phantek Evolv X case. I had it running a stable 5.2 at 1.29 V but lowered it. When I get a new CPU I don't like to stress it at the beginning. I allow it to break in for a week or two. I'm running it on an ASUS Formula XI board. Excellent board for OC. Not a problem with anything I've thrown at it. Real quality board. Very pleased with that purchase too. All in all, I'm very satisfied and hats off to Intel and ASUS. One thing Intel needs to work on is getting the heat down. This processor does need a custom water loop to exploit it.

Love it,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2019","First off, I don't understand why people say this thing runs hot.  I am running a Corsair 115i water cooler and so far the hottest it has got is 125 degrees.  98% of the time it runs 85 to 90 degrees F.  I love it.  I was using the threadripper 1920X and personally I think the 9900k puts it to shame.  Now the amd ran hot all the time and after a year of using it, the thing just wasn't holding up.  There are alot of negative people out there, so go with your guts and just buy it and properly cool it and there will be no issues.  I can't say enough how much I just love this processor, everything I throw at it and it barely gets pushed.  You can't go wrong, I promise.

At a price.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2019","I upgraded from a i7-4790k and the difference is extremely noticeable. This by far has the fastest single core clock speed and the multicore performance is amazing. I have my 9900k OCd at 5 GHz and it's perfectly stable using a Gigabyte Aorus Master MOBO. The only complaint I have when it comes to performance with it being OCd are the Temps. They definitely get high and I'm running a 360mm Corsair radiator. It is an AIO so I imagine if you got a custom loop system it would work better than what I have but for now, it's workable. The only other gripe I have is the price. This is by far the most expensive CPU I've ever bought, 529.99 when I purchased mine, but in my opinion it's totally worth it if you're trying to future proof your build.

X-Plane is processor-intensive, and the i9-9900k's 5Ghz clock speed resulted in a 20% frame rate increase while using the same GTX 1080 graphics card from my old system.  My results have varied when playing other games, but all of them have shown at least some improvement.Early reviews for this processor stated that it ran hot and cooling it adequately was an issue. However,  I purchased a new Corsair H100i Pro at the same time, and it never exceeds 60 degrees under load using that cooler.  Idle temperatures are in the high 20s and low 30s.
